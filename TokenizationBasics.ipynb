    "Tokenization is the process of transforming a string or document into smaller chunks aka tokens. This is one step in preparing a text for NLP. You can create tokenization rules by using Regex. Or we can use the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit Library). Why tokenize? It's easier to map parts of speech, match common words, and remove unwanted tokens. \n",
