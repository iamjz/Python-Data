    "## Stop Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Text documents often contain many occurrences of the same word. For example, in a document written in _English_, words such as _a_, _the_, _of_, and _it_ likely occur very frequently. When classifying a document based on the number of times specific words occur in the text document, these words can lead to biases, especially since they are generally common in **all** text documents you might want to classify. As a result, the concept of [_stop words_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words) was invented. Basically these words are the most commonly occurring words that should be removed during the tokenization process in order to improve subsequent classification efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily specify that the __English__ stop words should be excluded during tokenization by using the `stop_words`. Note, _stop word_ dictionaries for other languages, or even specific domains, exist and can be used instead. We demonstrate the removal of stop words by using a `CountVectorizer` in the following simple example.\n",

    "## Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have looked at several techniques to remove redundant or unimportant features. For example, we changed the case of all text to lowercase and we have applied stop words. However, there still is the issue of different forms of the same word, for example compute, computer, computed, and computing. The process of changing words back to their root, or basic form (by removing prefixes and suffixes) so that token frequencies match the use of the root token rather than being spread across multiple similar tokens is known as [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming). \n",
    "\n",
    "The most widely used stemmer, or program/method that performs stemming, is the _Porter Stemmer_, which was originally published in 1980 by Martin Porter. An improved version was released in 2000, which fixed a number of errors. NLTK includes the Porter Stemmer, which can be used with scikit learn by creating a special function that tokenizes text documents and passing this function as an argument to the `CountVectorizer` via the `tokenizer` attribute. By performing stemming inside this tokenize method, we can return a set of tokens for a document that have been stemmed. In the following code cell, we use a custom `tokenize` method that first builds a list of tokens by using nltk, and then maps the Porter stemmer to the list of tokens to generate a stemmed list.\n",

\\nwatch the movie and \" sorta \" find out . . . \\ncritique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . \\nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn\\'t snag this one correctly . \\nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \\nso what are the problems with the movie ? \\nwell , its main problem is that it\\'s simply too jumbled . \\nit starts off \" normal \" but then downshifts into this \" fantasy \" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what\\'s going on . \\nthere are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \\nnow i personally don\\'t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film\\'s biggest problem . \\nit\\'s obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \\nand do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \\nnot really . \\nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn\\'t the make the film all that more entertaining . \\ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \\ni mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \\nokay , we get it . . . there \\nare people chasing her and we don\\'t know who they are . \\ndo we really need to see it over and over again ? \\nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \\napparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \\nthere might\\'ve been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \\nthe actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \\nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character\\'s unraveling . \\noverall , the film doesn\\'t stick because it doesn\\'t entertain , it\\'s confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \\noh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it\\'s \\njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \\nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . \\nwhatever . . . skip \\nit ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\na nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow : salvation ( 4/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - memento ( 10/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - stir of echoes ( 8/10 ) \\n', b'the happy bastard\\'s quick movie review \\ndamn that y2k bug . \\nit\\'s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . \\nlittle do they know the power within . . . \\ngoing for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . \\nwe don\\'t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don\\'t know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don\\'t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . \\nhere , it\\'s just \" hey , let\\'s chase these people around with some robots \" . \\nthe acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . \\nyou\\'re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . \\nsutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he\\'s acting like a baldwin , of course . \\nthe real star here are stan winston\\'s robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone\\'s brain . \\nso , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here\\'s your movie . \\notherwise , it\\'s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . \\n']\n"

      "[b'there is a striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \\nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \\nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \\nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \\nit is an important scene for several reasons . \\nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \\nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \\nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like \" angels in the outfield \" ( 1994 ) or \" michael \" ( 1996 ) . \\nthe angels here are stark and believable . \\nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god\\'s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \\nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \\nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \\nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \\n \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \\nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \\nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \\nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it\\'s not enough . \\nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \\nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . \\nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n . y . p . d . \\nblue \" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \\nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage\\'s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person\\'s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \\nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \\n \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender\\'s haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" \\nwenders\\' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \\nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \\nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn\\'t suffer extensive damage . \\nthis may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not an attempt to copy it . \\nand yet , \" city of angels \" is not a typical hollywood movie . \\nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \\nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \\nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \\nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \\nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \\ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \\nwhat is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \\nit\\'s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \\nit doesn\\'t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \\ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \\n____________________________________________ visit \"

half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled \" dragnet \" reruns off the air . \\nsure , i\\'d seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv . \\neven though \" dragnet \" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50\\'s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous \" blue boy \" episode of \" dragnet . \" \\nfor anyone like me who got laughs out of webb\\'s rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i . \\nas what would happen if sgt . \\njoe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic . \\nin this election year , i\\'m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth . \\nthe movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb\\'s office door and enters . \\nhe gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up . \\nthe \" produced and directed by jack webb \" card pretty much goes without saying . \\nthis is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot . \\ni certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i . \\ngives us more -- much more . \\nwebb\\'s mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up . \\nthe captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will \" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . \" \\n ( whether the \" lace panties \" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . ) \\nthis , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens\\' life a living hell . \\nfor those of you who haven\\'t been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here\\'s a reprint of a typical monologue of his . \\ni can\\'t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i\\'m talking about . . . \\n \" now you listen to me , youngster . \\nsomeday you\\'ll wake up fighting on a beach and you\\'ll pray to god somebody doesn\\'t get killed because of your foolishness . . . \\ni\\'ve got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you\\'re gonna turn around and i\\'ll be standing right there . \" \\ni couldn\\'t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i . \\n ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day\\'s work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) . \\nhe meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i . \\nwebb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , \" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? \" \\nbogart he ain\\'t . \\nthe other d . i . \\ngets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , \" he\\'s a damn good d . i . \\n . . . \\ni guess i\\'m just a little jealous . \" \\njoin the club , we\\'re all jealous of jack webb\\'s way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman\\'s place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display . \\n \" you expect me to talk to you . . . \\nin _here_ ? ! \" he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras . \\nthe woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen . \\na little girl spots him in the store and demands , \" what are you doing in here . . . you\\'re a man , aren\\'t you ? \" \\nhe doesn\\'t reply , but you know he\\'s thinking in his head , \" what an odd species of human -- so small . \\nmust be one of those children everyone\\'s been talking about . \" \\nthis poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he\\'s responsible for . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t focus too closely on webb\\'s romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills . \\nafter two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , \" was that flea you killed a male or female ? \" \\nowens replies , \" a male , sir . \" \\nwebb yells to the platoon , \" this ain\\'t the one ! \" \\nthat such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment . \\nbut we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century . \\nwebb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines . \\nsomeone wanting to parody this movie couldn\\'t do a more comical job than webb did . \\nit makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself . \\nthere\\'s a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter . \\nwebb bursts in the room and shouts , \" what did i tell you about laughing ? ! \" \\nto which the private replies , \" sir , only nine-year-old girls laugh , sir ! \" \\nand let me tell you , i was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie . \\n', b\"stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder . \\ngrim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento . \\nboasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento . \\nit follows his disappointing

\\nposing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . \\na gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives . \\nthe stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario . \\nit is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration . \\nthe script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . \\nbut as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years . \\nargento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . \\neffects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent . \\nthe film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style . \\nproof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers . \\nthe cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless . \\nasia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . \\nit's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . \\nthomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . \\nbut perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack . \\nactive since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . \\nit's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . \\nit's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together . \\nthis is a long welcome reunion . \\nif the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax . \\nbut by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career . \\n * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can . \\ndubs of this version are

straight . \\nsurrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting . \\nthat was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue . \\nit\\'s not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word . \\nthough the film is distinctive , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes , and as it progressed , watching became a chore . \\nthe only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary ed wood , the man behind such \" classics \" as plan 9 >from outer space and night of the ghouls . \\nthe joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they\\'re good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits . \\ni woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it\\'s really bad . \\nit stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money . \\nour thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual . \\nhe falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone . \\nfor whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back (

each of them and kill them if they don\\'t have what he is looking for . \\ni don\\'t think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short . \\nthe subject and the style seem to have been made for it . \\nunfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome . \\nit grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary . \\nit might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is . \\ni woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me . \\nunlike most ed wood films , this one tries to be funny and fails , instead of the other way around . \\nthere\\'s nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so \" good \" at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one . \\nwhether wood actually went for comedy in his script we\\'ll never know , but in either case , this is a failure . \\njonathan taylor thomas , christina ricci , summer phoenix , john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos . \\nricci , for example , plays a prostitute . \\nher role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out . \\nthomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff . \\nwas the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work ? \\nzane , meanwhile , occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up . \\nlack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature . \\nthe carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no-budget production . \\nit\\'s desperately unfunny , but thinks it\\'s the funniest thing since plan 9 ; , it\\'s so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in

other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . \\nbut also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . \\nonce again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name . \\nthis jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . \\nof course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . \\nother plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . \\nthe sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . \\ndirector samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . \\nother impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . \\nnone of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . \\nbut the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) . \\nfilmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . \\nhopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before . \\n\", b'sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and \" pushing tin \" certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he\\'s actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people . \\nsometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has \" hip comedy \" written all over it , compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction , compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits , compensate for clich ? d characterizations , compensate for embarrassing \" you have to be joking \" situations . \\netc . \\nin \" pushing tin , \" thornton , blanchett , jolie , and cusack don\\'t have an earthly . \\nfrom the opening sequence the film is in big trouble : squiggly , \" quirky \" credits , fake-looking passenger planes circling new york , and anne dudley\\'s in-your-ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for \" the full monty , \" let alone won it . \\nbut i , for one , wasn\\'t ready to walk just yet . \\nso quickly we descend into a tightly-edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job , yes , what with their frantic , mile-a-minute instructional personas , juggling planes and passenger\\'s lives like some huge , real , mid-air video game . \\nhip , cool , demonic auctioneer nick \" the zone \" falzone ( cusack ) is the best in the biz . \\nof course . \\nuntil some hipper , cooler , leather-clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell ( thornton ) shows up to challenge falzone\\'s finite air space . \\nboys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding , then the macho one-upmanship begins . \\nit doesn\\'t stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat\\'s whisker of each other . \\noh no . \\nthere are some broken hoop dreams , some wanna-see-how-fast-i-can-drives , and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ? \\ndirector mike newell ( \" four weddings and a funeral \" ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that\\'s being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia doesn\\'t have an ounce of subtlety , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before . \\nthe antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe . \\nthey\\'ll make you frown in disbelief . \\nthey\\'ll have you constantly looking at your watch . \\nbut wait ! \\nthere\\'s still 100 minutes to go ! ! \\nthe film\\'s only saving grace is blanchett , whose connie falzone is a spunky , brash , long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes . \\nthis is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler ( \" oscar and lucinda \" ) and a tempestuous british monarch ( \" elizabeth \" ) . \\nbut she\\'s not enough to save the picture . \\nthornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke . \\njolie ( as russell\\'s knock \\'em dead wife ) isn\\'t bad , but the up-and-coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything . \\ncusack cracks gum , dons shades , and acts hip throughout but , like everything else in the film , his performance is forced . \\nin the last ten minutes or so , for some inexplicable reason , things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been , like the trailer teases . \\nbut it\\'s too little too late . \\na fine cast aside , \" pushing tin \" is nothing more than an embarrassment . \\n', b'since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993\\'s steven spielberg drama \" schindler\\'s list \" and directed 1993\\'s intelligent \" searching for bobby fischer , \" his new film , \" a civil action , \" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . \\nwhat doesn\\'t make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . \\nthe film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \\nbased on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , \" a civil action \" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children\\'s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \\njan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families\\' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city\\'s drinking water . \\nsuddenly , after hearing about the families\\' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . \\nalso figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods\\' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . \\ncoming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , \" a civil action \" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . \\nperhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . \\nwatching the film , i couldn\\'t help but notice its similarities with 1997\\'s far , far superior film \" the sweet hereafter , \" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . \\nin his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . \\nnot only was the plotting similar to \" a civil action , \" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . \\nconsidering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful \" a sweet hereafter \" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm\\'s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . \\nin \" a civil action , \" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . \\nwe do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . \\nthrough its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta\\'s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn\\'t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . \\nevery scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . \\nyou\\'ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents\\' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what \" a civil action \" does . \\nto be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . \\naside from one flashback to when a man\\'s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . \\ni could say the performances were good , but who\\'s fooling who ? \\nsince every character is one-dimensionally written , no one\\'s acting abilities are challenged in any way . \\ntravolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that\\'s about all he does . \\nduvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . \\nand what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture\\'s final scene , as a judge ? \\nshe appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? \\nfinally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? \\nabruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , \" a civil action \" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with . \\n', b'woof ! too bad that leap of faith was the title of a 1992 comedy starring steve martin and debra winger , because that\\'s what\\'s required to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis as--of all things--a psychologist . \\nnot since the reagan administration has there been an acting stretch of such magnitude ! \\nalas , mickey rourke , we hardly knew ye . \\nstory opens with a campy kick--willis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy . \\nshe goes splat , he goes ugh , and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind . \\nreally . \\nthe good doctor then moves to sunny l . a . , where he rooms with an old college chum ( scott bakula ) , a therapist who\\'s getting death threats from someone in his monday evening group . \\nbuddy bites it in the second reel ( no surprise there ) and willis agrees to take over both the group and the death threats . \\nfor his troubles as therapy man , willis gets to share some cut-from-nc17 love scenes with the lover\\'s jane march while dodging nails , cars , and rattlesnakes . \\nwhy\\'d it have to be snakes ? \\ncolor of night is the worst movie of the year . \\nperiod . \\nforget north , clifford , or , heaven help us , even on deadly ground . \\nhere is a movie misfire so audaciously awful that you can\\'t help but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming . \\nfor starters , the \" group \" is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis . \\nthese are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy ? \\nplaying a prissy obsessive/compulsive , cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif , alone , may set the psychology profession back ten years . \\nthe plot\\'s a wreck with laughable dialogue , pointless pov shifts , and the one big secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes . \\ndirector richard rush , who once helmed freebie and the bean , doesn\\'t seem to mind . \\nunfazed by the nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations , he overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany set-pieces to make the effort almost worth watching . \\nhis token freeway chase is ok , but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala ( most recently ) fatal analysis . \\nacting credits are across-the-board awful . \\nwillis can be forgiven because he\\'s filming die hard 3 as we speak . \\nbut what about ruben blades insulting presence as the cop ? \\nor lesley ann warren\\'s stereotypical sex addict ? \\nor worst offender jane march as a mystery-girl-who\\'s-no-real-mystery ? \\nshudder . \\nbottom line : how they all kept straight faces , i\\'ll never know . \\n', b'the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic . \\nfinding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . \\ncombining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of \" kramer vs . \\nkramer \" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment . \\nin yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? \\n-- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere . \\nover-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life . \\nhe\\'s screwed up things pretty well ( \" i had a wife and daughter . \\nnow , i\\'m a drunk ) and is at a crossroads . \\na couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them . \\nthe ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends . \\none gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up . \\nto fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine . \\njack is in even worse shape than harry . \\nhe\\'s dying of cancer with only a year to live . \\nthings do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him . \\ninstead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes . \\nthis unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine\\'s first husband 20 years before . \\nthrough a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel\\'s mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross\\'s former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to . \\nit\\'s a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about . \\nthe only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario . \\nby the time they show you , it doesn\\'t matter . \\nthe storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross\\'s relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe . \\nthese scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither . \\nrubin and ross have some past relationship but either it\\'s not explained or i didn\\'t care enough at that point to remember . \\na running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform . \\nit\\'s also not funny , doesn\\'t connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course . \\non the positive side , it\\'s often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen . \\nthe three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs . \\nnewman is a grand actor , but doesn\\'t seem quite suited to the dark film style . \\nhe is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out . \\nhackman , also low-key , is believable but lacks sparkle . \\nsarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one-dimensional . \\nthe actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can\\'t pull the film out of the hole it\\'s dug for itself . \\njames garner who plays ross\\'s old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half-heartedly struggles through lines like \" i\\'m glad they didn\\'t shoot your pecker off . \" \\nthe best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make . \\nthe genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen \\nthe film doesn\\'t run very long before the audience realizes that it\\'s hopeless . \\nthe only reason for watching is the actors . \\nit reminds me of disaster movies such as \" towering inferno \" where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film\\'s problems . \\nin a better world , there would have been second-rate actors in this second-rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better . \\nof course , we don\\'t live in that better world , but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie . \\n', b'mars attacks ! \\n ( 1996 ) - c : jack nicholson , glenn close ,

mind to enjoy this film . \\nit is completely wacked-out and unlike anything you\\'ve ever seen . \\nonce the silly tone of the film is set , it\\'s easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just don\\'t mix . \\nthe plot is simple : martians invade the earth . \\nbut it\\'s different than any other invasion film . \\nusually it\\'s the evil aliens versus the heroic humans . \\nthis time however , it\\'s the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans . \\nthe martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i\\'ve seen in a long time . \\nthey look funny , they move funny , and their \" language \" is hilarious . \\nand about the special effects . \\nthe effects in mars attacks ! \\nare just about the most flawless ones i\\'ve seen to date . \\nthe computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100% real . \\nthere are just a couple of scenes that don\\'t work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship . \\nalso , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise . \\nbut there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood . \\ncould it have been funnier ? \\ncertainly . \\nwas it funny enough ? \\nyes . \\nwas i entertained ? \\nabsolutely . \\non a personal note , i\\'d like to thank whomever cast rod steiger ( my favorite actor ) in the film as war-crazy general decker . \\nfinally , after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles , steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see . \\nwhile he\\'s not given the type of role that you can give a real \" performance \" in , he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue . \\nthe preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him . \\n', b'eyes wide shut isn\\'t the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick\\'s final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex . \\nit\\'s a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur\\'s trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast \" hostage \" on the set for nearly a year ) . \\nin an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman . \\nthey play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other . \\nhe is an m . d . , she\\'s unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party . \\nat the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else . \\nwhen they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night . \\nhe ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with . \\nthey proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer . \\nshe admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night . \\nbill is jolted by alice\\'s story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go \" show his face \" at the house of a just-deceased patient . \\nthis turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town . \\nthe daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down . \\nhe almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street . \\nthen , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other . \\nerotic dread mounts as cruise ( who\\'s not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the \" action \" until he is discovered to be an outsider . \\nmuch hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros . digitally edited the orgy scene . \\nwith the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc-17 rating . \\neuropean viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it . \\nroger ebert calls the american version the \" austin powers version , \" and many others have bashed the alterations . \\ni am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene\\'s mystical atmosphere . \\nthe first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks . \\nthis is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery . \\nfrom the giant mansion used in the film\\'s centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford\\'s apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at . \\nto boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still . \\nat the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity . \\nit looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic . \\nit\\'s something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship . \\nat the end , it seems , bill\\'s eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york . \\nkubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman . \\ntom is completely convincing as dr . harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take . \\nnicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she\\'s headed for an oscar nod . \\nthe movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director-cum-thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford\\'s mysterious friend . \\neyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor-happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good- looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander . \\nstill , this is an important work from a great director , and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick\\'s best it is a worthy final film , a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n', b'i know that \" funnest \" isn\\'t a word . \\n \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \\nbut that\\'s the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" \\nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i\\'ve ever seen ! \" \\nso to hell with webster\\'s -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i\\'ve seen in a while . \\ni can\\'t remember the last time i\\'ve seen anything funner . \\nthe chickens at tweedy\\'s farm are up to something . \\nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \\none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \\nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm\\'s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \\nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" \\nwhat sort of pies ? \\nchicken pies , of course . \\nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \\nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \\npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \\n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \\nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \\nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \\nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \\nthing is , the film doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \\npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \\npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \\nbut they\\'re * chickens * , so it\\'s funny to us . \\nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\\'s films ) succeed is the animators\\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\\'re cribbing . \\nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \\nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \\nthere\\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\\'s nationality and film history . \\nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \\nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \\nconsider this : since july of last year , i\\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \\nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \\nwhy ? \\nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\\'re parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch\\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \\nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \\nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \\nif you\\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \\neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \\npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \\nenjoyment of this movie doesn\\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \\nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \\nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \\nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \\nthe characters\\' inevitable romance doesn\\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \\npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\\'t any help . \\njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \\nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \\none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \\nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \\nthe animation is first-rate . \\nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \\nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \\nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \\ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\\'ll catch all the details . \\nanyway , the movie\\'s just a boatload of fun . \\nfunnest damn movie i\\'ve seen all year . \\n', b'in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see . \\ni realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike . \\nbut in the case of american beauty , i must make an exception . \\nif you haven\\'t yet seen it , go see it . \\nnow . \\nstop reading this review and head for your local multiplex , then after you\\'ve seen it , come back . \\ni\\'ll wait here . \\nwelcome back . \\nif you followed my advice ( and i see no reason why you should not have , do you ? ) , \\ni\\'m sure you\\'ve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life . \\namerican beauty is an extraordinary film , a powerful , jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream . \\nit\\'s humorous but it isn\\'t funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production . \\nmixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended , and by god , it works , making it one of the year\\'s very best . \\nlester burnham ( kevin spacey ) has entered the mother of all mid-life crises . \\nhe is living life without a purpose . \\nhe is bored , depressed and sick of his sheltered , insignificant existence . \\nhe barely ever talks to his family , has no sex life , is stuck at a dead-end job and thinks he has no reason to live . \\nbut one day , when he and his equally troubled wife ( annette bening ) attend one of his daughter\\'s ( thora birch ) cheerleading performances , he sees something that makes him come alive . \\nwhat he sees is the performance by his daughter\\'s friend , the head cheerleader . \\nhe develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl ; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature . \\nbut for the first time , lester feels that he is actually living . \\nthis crush is only the beginning . \\nlester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life , buying the car of his dreams , cursing off the boss and quitting his job ( \" today i quit my job , told the boss to f * * * himself and blackmailed him for $60 , 000 -- would you pass the asparagus please ? \" ) , \\nbuying drugs from the voyeur-next-door ( ricky fitts , a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be \" beauty \" ) and refusing to be docile in family affairs . \\nhis new attitude further alienates his daughter , only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be , and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor . \\nand the burnhams\\'s neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum . \\nricky fitts ( wes bentley ) serves as the film\\'s thematic center , providing the obscure , powerful meaning of the title . \\ncolonel fitts , the father , is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie , even considering his limited screentime . \\nkevin spacey has never been better , and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel . \\nhe never plays his droll character as a freak , rather , he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self-exploration by his dissatisfaction with life . \\nspacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime . \\nequally astonishing is young thora birch , who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness . \\nat two hours and ten minutes , american beauty didn\\'t feel nearly long enough . \\nit\\'s a complicated , unforgettable film that , like the ice storm two years ago , dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life . \\npowerfully and cynically , it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream . \\nit claims that this picture-perfect image is just that -- an image , and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it . \\nthe dark , deeply ironic ending , though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie , stays with you for weeks after it\\'s all over . \\namerican beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released ; even more so considering it\\'s a masterpiece . \\n', b\"i'm giving this stinker . \\nnormally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be . \\nbut the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg . \\ni'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all . \\nmaybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny . \\nin mine , it's not . \\nor maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking . \\nbecause only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one . \\nat least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing . \\nbrooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it . \\nwrong mel ! \\ni would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere . \\nthis idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad . \\nhe sends his goons to run the townsfolk out . \\nbut the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them . \\nthe governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr . \\n ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . ) \\nlamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave . \\nhold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass . \\nit's just too funny . \\nracism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ? \\noh wait , i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk . \\ni'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head . \\nbut i digress . \\nanyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word . \\ngolly , will the hilarity just never end ? \\nhe ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west . \\ntogether , they save the day from evil . \\nnot one person in this movie gives a decent performance . \\nwilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie . \\nok , he really didn't -- but he should have . \\nthe films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day . \\ni did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience . \\ni admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions . \\nactually , the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise , but alas , it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie . \\ni can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \\nmel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film . \\n\", b'birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives . \\nare we doing what we want to be doing ? \\nwhat happened to our dreams ? \\nwith the new millennium , our collective big birthday , just around the corner , some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence . \\nthe old standbys of traditional religion and science aren\\'t doing it for many anymore and they\\'re looking for something else . \\nwe\\'ll be seeing more

humanity . \\nit _is_ a mish-mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog . \\ni am willing to put up with preaching from a film , but the messages here are old hat . \\nyou should

that there\\'s only a hint of laughter from the audience . \\nmurphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better . \\nthere are hints of promise in this one . \\nthe only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved-headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen . \\nthe others are horrendous . \\ngoldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career , but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his \" invasion of the body snatchers \" . \\nhis relationship with kate makes no sense . \\nthey move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen . \\npreston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be . \\nsomewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value . \\nan attempt to satirize stupid

movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair . \\nelijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth . \\ntea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth . \\nalso featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother . \\nwhile many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one . \\nthe main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all . \\nonly the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters . \\nand because i couldn't care for them , i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not . \\nthe script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements . \\nmimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame . \\nthe cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good . \\nshe seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist . \\nrobert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money . \\nelijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i . e . \\nflipper , 1996 ) . \\nhis role is also vastly underwritten . \\nmorgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role . \\nlike duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money . \\nthe supporting cast are all o . k , none making much of an impression . \\nok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ? \\nwell , yes and no . \\nalthough the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects . \\nsadly , the waves looks like it's been drawn on computer , and doesn't look too good at all . \\nsurprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister . \\nin the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity . \\nwhat could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects . \\nthe 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect . \\nonce again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie . \\nlet's hope armageddon is a bit better . \\noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \\n\", b\"forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . \\nset in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . \\nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . \\nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . \\nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . \\ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? \\nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? \\nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . \\nthis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . \\nthe play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . \\nin the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . \\nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . \\nit positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . \\nnot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . \\nwhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . \\nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . \\nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . \\nappropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . \\ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . \\notherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . \\nryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . \\nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . \\nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . \\npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . \\nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . \\na scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . \\nunfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . \\nit is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . \\nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . \\nthe result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . \\nwhen the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . \\nfar from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . \\n\", b'for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality , trois is surprisingly tame . \\ndespite it\\'s lurid subject matter and it\\'s passing nod to fatal attraction , it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film . \\nfreshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life . \\nthey have a beautiful house in suburbia . \\njermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm . \\njasmine is his supportive wife , who is finishing up her college degree . \\nin an opening montage via a home video of the pair , we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs . \\nthis is a couple that has it all . \\ninto this eden slithers the lure of lust . \\ndespite his outward appearance , jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person . \\na glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business , oblivious to jasmine\\'s concerns . \\nwe also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a-trois , much to jasmine\\'s dismay . \\nas jermaine puts it , \" don\\'t you want to be sexually free ? \" \\njermaine shares his desire with co-worker terrence ( smith ) , who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter . \\nthe woman , jade ( palmer ) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine . \\njade , at one point was a college student , too . \\nunlike jasmine , she found herself pregnant , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet . \\nto further reinforce their differences , it\\'s revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son . \\ninevitably , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine\\'s part , the forbidden act is consummated . \\nthe aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine\\'s property with the hint that the violence may escalate . \\nby this point , trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama : a fatal attraction without the social significance . \\nthe exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical . \\njermaine comes off as insincere , sexually driven and selfish . \\njasmine is bland and subservient . \\njade comes off a bit sympathetically , but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy . \\nyet another tale of a sexually aggressive \" dog \" of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating , innocent mate . \\nthe last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve , but by this point , will you even care ? \\nif the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending , perhaps there could have been some freshness to it . \\nas it stands , trois is pretty standard fare . \\n', b'jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons , an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities . \\nchan plays separated-at-births boomer and john ma , whose drastically different paths . . . \\naw , forget the plot description , it\\'s not even worth the space . \\nbut let\\'s face it . \\nno one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway . \\nthe scenes where nothing happens in chan\\'s films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together . \\nin the case of twin dragons , however , the tiresome plot-driving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout ( at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema ) , \" get to the good part already ! \" \\nmost of the film is devoted to showing the brothers\\' efforts to hide the other\\'s existence from their own acquaintances . \\nwhy it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained , but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot . \\nthe twins\\' love interests , demure club-singer barbara ( chan-film regular maggie cheung ) and lusty bride-hopeful tammy ( nina li chi ) , get disoriented in all the brouhaha , yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with . \\nthe scenes describing the boys\\' bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot ( in several shots , in fact , even the make-up and hair people seem to forget which brother is which . ) . \\neven chan\\'s so-corny-it\\'s-funny humor is off-kilter in this outing . \\nsome of the gags are so carefully innocuous they\\'re annoying . \\na case in point : whenever anyone sees the brothers together , they fall to the ground in a dead faint . \\nare we laughing yet ? \\nas usual , the final showdown is the film\\'s jewel , a tour de force display of chan\\' s agility and grace . \\nnever mind that it\\'s not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash-testing facility . \\nit\\'s all good fun , but too little too late . \\nperhaps chan\\'s next movie should just be a collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies . \\nthey could call it jackie chan\\'s the final fight scenes , and everybody would go home happy .

impressive work . \\nroth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade\\'s right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers . \\ngiamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal . \\ntim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about , most spectacularly when mounting his steed , but even\\'s he\\'s undone by some obvious wire work . \\nbonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic , but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing . \\nmost of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover . \\nthe ape\\'s city resembles a dank complex of tree houses . \\nthe apes\\' military costumes ( colleen atwood , \" sleepy hollow \" ) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka\\'s work on coppola\\'s \" dracula . \" \\nthat oriental flavor is also found in danny elfman\\'s tribal , percussive score . \\n \" planet of the apes \" was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001 , a dismal movie season that\\'s going to the dogs . \\n', b'one of these days , i\\'ll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie . \\nking of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings . \\nit\\'s a perfume-drenched , coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains . \\nferrara\\'s only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he\\'s onscreen . \\nhis 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure . \\nwhen he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there\\'s a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair . \\nyou know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they\\'re actually having fun ? \\nthe addiction is that movie . \\nwalken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout . \\nthe central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island ) . \\nmuch like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni\\'s terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill \" relationship \" with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she\\'s a model . ) \\nmatty\\'s lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara\\'s entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout . \\nno kidding . \\nrequiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara\\'s movies and his controversial urban lifestyle . \\nmatty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him . \\nno doubt , he was off chasing the dragon . \\nin his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full \" dirty ol\\' man \" mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs . \\nwider ! ) \\ntoward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out . \\nsomething happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it\\'s exactly what you think it was . \\nsuffice to say , there\\'s some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all . \\nthe blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea . \\ncinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and we\\'re back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits . \\n \" yeah ! ! ! \\nyeah ! ! ! \\narrrghhh ! \" \\nsays mr . hopper . \\ndirty old sod . ) \\nit\\'s compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny . \\nhow\\'s that for cryptic ? \\nnever fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he\\'s all about . \\ni can picture it now . \\n \" take off yer clothes , kid -- it\\'s essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you\\'re his visual id . \\nyou\\'re the soul , the heart , the bloodstream of the picture . \\ntake it off ! \\ntake it all off ! ! ! \\nha ha ha ! \" \\nfriggin\\' vampire . \\nyeah , you , ferrara . \\na final word about matthew modine : he\\'s actually a fine actor when properly cast , but there\\'s something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor . \\nhe\\'s ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations , such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time-bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene , though no one seems to notice him ) . \\n[he was in that scene ? \\n-ed . ] \\nhere , he\\'s asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs . \\nhe throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it\\'s somehow lacking . \\nmodine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara\\'s flesh fair . \\nbetter luck next time , matt . \\nsomeday , you\\'ll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn\\'t really your fault in the first place . \\nmaybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere , and all will once again be well in your world . \\n', b'i admit it . \\ni thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies . \\nwatching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids . \\nit was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation . \\nand you know they\\'ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa\\'s elves . \\nhe later decks a reindeer . \\nhey , man , why don\\'t you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you\\'re at it ? \\njingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought . \\narnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene . \\nwhat can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can\\'t find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ? \\narnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son . \\nhe races from the office to his son\\'s karate game , only to find out he missed it . \\nand his kid distrusts him because he\\'s never around . \\n ( gee , we haven\\'t seen that in a movie before . ) \\narnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son\\'s affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago . \\nso arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out . \\nlet me back up for a minute here -- arnold\\'s kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief . \\nwatches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin\\' turboman sheets . \\ni\\'d try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it\\'s a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . \\nbut nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don\\'t recognize him until the last minute . \\nthis is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory . \\nmost painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll . \\ncapitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful . \\nnever mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( \" your cookies are incredible \" ) , it\\'s the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it\\'s okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want . \\nmaybe that\\'s what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine . \\n', b\"the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies i've seen in years . \\nbut then again , i've always had this phobia of asian born horror films . \\ni remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced , long-haired floating ghosts donning their white gowns\\x05\\x05euuugh . \\nthe ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended . \\nunlike the horror films coming from the west , i'm pretty much used to the gore and visual effects , so much so , they become rather bland nowadays . \\nthere's really no scary movie from the west for a long time . \\nif you have something in mind , please tell me . \\nthis japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by `the stephen king of japan' , which is also ( i heard ) televised over the air in japan . \\nthe film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it , one week prior to viewing . \\na journalist and her husband , stupid enough , tests the so call `urban legend' and ends up having a week before she meets her doom . \\nshe and her husband then goes on a search for the origin of the videocassette , to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves . \\nthe ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today . \\nvisual subtlety , minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film . \\nvery well done indeed , especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence and gore . \\nnow , that\\x12s something budding horror film-maker wannabes should consider looking into . \\njust an idea of how visually powerful the film is , it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese ; both of which , i can't understand at all ( ok , i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching , but he revealed very little ! ) . \\nthe twists in the plot , leading to an unforgettable climax ( will definitely leave an impression on the audience ) will have you at the edge of your seat . \\n\", b'susan granger\\'s review of \" legally blonde \" ( m . g . m . ) \\nit\\'s a \" pretty in pink \" / \" clueless \" coming-of-age story for the new millennium as elle woods ( reese witherspoon ) , a perky southern california sorority queen , switches from fashion to law in order to win back her yuppy boyfriend ( matthew davis ) . \\nthe girl-power story begins as this sweetheart of delta nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who says : \" if i\\'m going to be a senator by the time i\\'m 30 . . . i \\nneed to marry a jackie , not a marilyn . \" \\ndetermined to prove she\\'s as smart a snobby brunette ( selma blair ) from country-club connecticut , elle not only applies to harvard law school but gets in , much to the amazement of family , friends and faculty . \\nonce there , this flaxen-haired fish-out-of-water not only survives but tenaciously thrives , befriending a local manicurist ( jennifer coolidge ) , dazzling a professor ( victor garber ) and rescuing a defendant ( ali larter ) in a celebrated boston murder trial , plus finding a more worthy beau ( luke wilson ) . \\nin the tradition of teen-comedy film-maker john hughes and his disciple amy heckerling , there\\'s wit , cheerfulness , a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem-solving . \\nfirst-time feature director robert luketic is blessed with reese witherspoon who\\'s joyously incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith , based on a soon-to-be-published novel by amanda brown . \\nthe supporting cast is terrific , particularly raquel welch and holland taylor - and i particularly got a kick out of the gag of elle distributing scented resumes in pink , her signature color on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" legally blonde \" is a frivolous , funny , feel-good 8 . \\nfilled with ditzy blonde ambition , it\\'s a movie for high-school kids that their parents would be happy to have them see . \\n', b'the film \" magnolia \" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . \\nthe dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . \\nthey all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . \\nthe numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially . \\nfrom a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain . \\nthey are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness . \\nwhether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one . \\n \" magnolia \" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of \" boogie nights \" fame . \\nthe detailed character analyses and the powerful script make \" magnolia \" memorable . \\nhowever , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . \\nanderson\\'s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . \\nhe also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of \" magnolia\\'s \" scenes drag on too long . \\nany three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . \\nfrom the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn\\'t get boring . \\nit is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . \\nthis is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . \\nevery character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . \\nfor example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall\\'s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . \\nthe fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . \\nanderson\\'s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . \\nthe only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . \\nthis was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . \\nthe performances in \" magnolia \" are perfection . \\nthis is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . \\nanderson allows many of hollywood\\'s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . \\nall of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . \\nworth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . \\nhe was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon\\'s character as phillip baker hall\\'s wife . \\nshe seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . \\n \" magnolia \" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . \\nanderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . \\nto see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . \\ndiversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . \\ni predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future . \\n', b'i have never been a \" star trek \" fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them . \\ni do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , \" star trek : insurrection , \" is no exception . \\ndropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series , \" first contact , \" \" insurrection , \" tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba\\'ku , as well as the fountain of youth . \\nat the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son\\'a , who want to push all of the ba\\'ku out so that their own race will not die out . \\nalso attacking the ba\\'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise . \\nafter returning to jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force . \\nso several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba\\'ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six-hundred-years-old , but looks to only be in her thirties . \\n \" star trek : insurrection , \" is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996\\'s \" first contact , \" which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different . \\nin , \" insurrection , \" however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement . \\nthe film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff . \\nmeanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly . \\nthis plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast . \\nare filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ? \\nanother element of , \" star trek , \" films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later . \\nalthough donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , \" first contact . \" \\nshe should have returned for this one , but i don\\'t blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie\\'s disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller . \\n \" star trek : insurrection , \" is perhaps the weakest film in the \" star trek , \" series , although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst , \" star trek v : the final frontier . \" \\n \" insurrection , \" is the type of \" safe \" sequel that will bewilder non-fans , since it is so low-tech compared to most of today\\'s blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not very good , either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts . \\non second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out . \\nthat way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness . \\n', b'after the press screening of \" moulin rouge , \" i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues . \\neveryone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images . \\na pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it . \\nanother enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye . \\nwhen one fellow quietly stated \" i\\'ve never really been a fan of musicals , \" the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn\\'t think of it as a musical . \\nthere is so much going on in \" moulin rouge \" that \" musical \" seems too small a term to cover it . \\n \" moulin rouge \" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o\\' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience . \\naustralian director baz luhrmann , the man behind \" strictly ballroom \" and \" romeo + juliet , \" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from \" the sound of music \" to \" smells like teen spirit . \" \\nsumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , \" moulin rogue \" travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the \" random \" setting . \\noh , and it has a story as well . \\n \" it was 1899 , the summer of love . . . \\n \" christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , \" to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , \" where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo ) . \\nchristian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor . \\nat once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying . \\nchristian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession . \\nworking with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named \" spectacular spectacular . \" \\nzidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there\\'s a catch ? the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine . \\nas if all that isn\\'t enough , satine has a cough , and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold , it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land . \\nlike a teeter-totter , \" moulin rogue \" moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime . \\none of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night , becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales . \\ntogether they dance , while serenaded by the man in the moon ( alessandro safina provides the vocals ) , apparently transported from the classic georges m ? li ? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky . \\nother scenes merely traffic in everything-and-the-kitchen-sink overload . \\nthe cavorting of toulouse-lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy , accompanied by cartoon sound effects , is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like \" bewitched \" beat into the ground . \\nof course , sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind . \\n \" we never heard from baz to turn it down , \" one of the actors told the los angeles times . \\n \" it was always , \\'more ! \\nmore ! \\' \" \\nthe director even sent a note to his cast reading , \" i dare you to make me say you\\'ve gone too far . \" \\nthe musical numbers reflect his attitude . \\none knockout piece , the \" elephant love medley , \" incorporates the beatles\\' \" all you need is love , \" u2\\'s \" in the name of love , \" dolly parton\\'s \" i will always love you \" and elton john and bernie taupin\\'s \" your song . \" \\nneed more ? \\nhow about \" diamonds are a girl\\'s best friend \" spiced with portions of \" material girl ? \" \\nluhrmann\\'s cast offers a wide variety of approaches that , together , add up to something messy , but often wonderful . \\newan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian , emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet . \\nmcgregor\\'s singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments . \\nonce labeled the \" ice queen , \" nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling , yet tender , performance . \\nshe handles the songs adroitly , although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range . \\nveteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler ? wait until you see him perform \" like a virgin . \" \\nas the buffoonish duke , richard roxburgh proves to be the film\\'s weakest link , although i\\'m sure he was simply following instructions . \\ni suspect \" moulin rogue \" will be one of those love-it-or-hate-it films . \\nwhile i didn\\'t completely love it , i most certainly liked it a lot . \\nover the course of a year , i see well over 300 movies , and most of them look like xeroxes of each other . \\n \" moulin rogue \" is an original , and an original , even a flawed one , is a thing to be cherished . \\n', b'in my opinion , a movie reviewer\\'s most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . \\nbut with soul survivors , i\\'m so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . \\nhowever , protocol forces me to do otherwise . \\nsoul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent . \\nparty girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) . \\nmatt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) . \\ndriving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash . \\nsean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her . \\nas cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him . \\nalong with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party . \\nannabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass\\'s visions . \\nshe has to figure out this purgatory all by herself . \\nrarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . \\nin his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . \\nwhen the movie\\'s camerawork isn\\'t pedestrian , it\\'s clich ? d . \\ncarpenter\\'s need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . \\nwe already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? \\nand the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . \\ncarpenter\\'s script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . \\nthis is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . \\nthe second lamest device , of course , is the , \" oh , it was all a dream \" resolution . \\nand guess what ? \\nthis movie has both ! \\nnot that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . \\nsince there\\'s no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . \\nthat\\'s a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . \\ncarpenter can\\'t even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . \\n[the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . \\n-ed . ] \\nwhen sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . \\nand when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they\\'re fully clothed . \\nregardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . \\nwhy wouldn\\'t they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? \\nwhy would they shower in their clothes ? \\nwhat if they weren\\'t covered in latex paint ? \\nthe cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . \\ni felt sorry for affleck , who i\\'ve liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . \\ndushku , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality , has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan . \\nas for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking . \\nand i\\'m not even getting into luke wilson\\'s role as a priest . \\nat least he\\'s friends with wes anderson . \\nbottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . \\n', b'denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . \\nthis perhaps may be washington\\'s very best to date . \\nhe joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly . \\nhis very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting \" the hurricane \" a much better film than it actually is . \\nwhen his rubin \" hurricane \" carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices . \\nthe horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago . \\nthe powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america\\'s history . \\nhe is that amazing . \\nthe problem with \" the hurricane \" is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles . \\nmainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors . \\nthis is , without a doubt , washington\\'s movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . \\ndenzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . \\nas rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . \\n>from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit . \\nthen after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder . \\ncarter\\'s second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed . \\nfrom these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america . \\nafter several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison . \\nit was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter\\'s book in the 1980\\'s , that a serious battle for freedom took place . \\nthe young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released . \\nthe greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation . \\nwashington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career . \\nthe devastation in washington\\'s eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it . \\nin the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot . \\nhis anger is heightened to a point of no control . \\nwe see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator . \\nwe see an emotional boxing match inside carter\\'s head . \\nfrom this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues . \\nit is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . \\nwhen carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts . \\nwhite people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head . \\nhowever , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him . \\nhe realizes that society is changing . \\nthat racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world . \\nvery rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . \\nif only the other actors had this same determination . \\ndan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around . \\nit felt like his character was taken straight out of a \" scooby doo \" episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn\\'t for those annoying little kids . \\n \" the kids \" in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . \\nthe lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in \" shawshank redemption \" ) . \\nthere is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . \\nhedaya was superb in \" clueless , \" same for david paymer in \" get shorty , \" harris yulin in \" ghostbusters \" and liev schreiber in \" the daytrippers . \" \\nit is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . \\non the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin \" hurricane \" carter . \\nthis role is about as far off from shallow as you can get . \\n', b'renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star\\'s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller . \\ntsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . \\nwriter steven e . desouza\\'s fairly straightforward plotline isn\\'t as outre as _double_team_\\'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . \\nvan damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans . \\nit\\'s all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . \\n . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . \\nwhile all of van damme\\'s films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting \" skills \" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme\\'s embarrassing directorial effort , 1996\\'s _the_quest_ ) . \\na lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : \" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! \" \\nand \" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! \" \\nstanding out among my favorites . \\nbut it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_\\'s laughs . \\nvan damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual . \\nearly scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus\\'s business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way . \\neven typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug . \\npaul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider\\'s cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode . \\nin rochon\\'s defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage . \\ntsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work . \\nhere , though , tsui\\'s visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise . \\nfor each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous . \\nthis is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context . \\nfor instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box . \\nas he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen . \\nit\\'s undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something . \\nthe test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired . \\ntsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza . \\nthere isn\\'t anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui\\'s legendary hong kong works ( but that\\'s a given going in ) . \\nif tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo\\'s stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . . \\nbefore it\\'s too late . \\nif he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . . \\nthat is , if it hasn\\'t already disappeared entirely after this fiasco . \\n', b'melvin van peebles\\' \" sweet sweetback\\'s baadasssss song \" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . \\nit was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . \\nits violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . \\nin style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , \" sweet sweetback \" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . \\nvan peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built \" sweet sweetback \" from the ground up almost entirely by himself . \\nbecause no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . \\nthe movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . \\nvan peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film\\'s responsibilities himself . \\nhe wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . \\nhe was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . \\nfor instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases \" rated x by an all-white jury , \" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . \\nhe also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . \\nthe storyline in \" sweet sweetback \" is deceptively simple . \\nit takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . \\none day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they\\'re bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . \\nhowever , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . \\nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . \\nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . \\nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles\\' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . \\nvan peebles\\' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . \\nat the beginning of \" sweet sweetback , \" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : \" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . \" \\nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . \\nof course , with today\\'s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , \" sweet sweetback \" doesn\\'t seem all that revolutionary . \\nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . \\nat that time , \" sweet sweetback \" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . \\ndistributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles\\' words , gave the black audience \" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . \" \\nof course , once it caught on , it caught on big . \\n \" sweet sweetback \" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates \" sweetback \" from other movies like \" shaft \" ( 1972 ) and \" the mack \" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . \\n \" sweet sweetback \" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . \\nhowever , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , \" sweet sweetback \" is certainly not without its controversies . \\nwhen it was first released , an article was published in \" ebony \" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . \\nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . \\nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . \\nstill others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . \\nnevertheless , a movie like \" sweet sweetback \" cannot be made without conflicting points of view . \\nit is a revolutionary movie not because it\\'s about one man\\'s defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . \\nuntil that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . \\nthe fact that \" sweet sweetback \" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply \" the black community \" ) . \\nvan peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between \" sweet sweetback \" and all movies that had come before it . \\nwhen the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . \\nnear the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , \" oh lord , let him die . \\ndon\\'t let them kill him . \\nlet him die on his own . \" \\nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn\\'t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . \\nand , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : \" watch out ! \\na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . \" \\nbeyond the political aspects , \" sweet sweetback \" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . \\nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . \\nhe shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . \\nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . \\nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . \\nwatching \" sweet sweetback \" more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . \\narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . \\nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect . \\nthe legacy of \" sweet sweetback\\'s baadasssss song \" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him . \\n', b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\n \" quick , robin ! \\nthe anti-shark repellant ! \" \\n- adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg \\ni had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard . \\nthis is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it\\'s loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill . \\nbatman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o\\'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss . \\nby ivy\\'s side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast . \\nthe villains\\' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy\\'s intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life . \\nmeanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) . \\nakiva goldsman\\'s screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement . \\nit makes goldsman\\'s screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison . \\ni am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i\\'d seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan\\'s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production . \\njoel schumacher\\'s direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance . \\nthere is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy\\'s chosen new abode . \\nanother action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons . \\nmr . schumacher\\'s focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective . \\nit is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film\\'s opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered . \\nis batman and robin supposed to be campy ? \\ni think it is - it\\'s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously . \\n ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted \" bomb ! \" \\neach time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . ) \\nis it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? \\ni somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn\\'t attempting to be the utter farce which it is . \\narnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . \\nmr . schwarzenegger\\'s attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . \\nby the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . \\nthe bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of \" cool ! \" \\nin the least inventive way . \\ngeorge clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . \\nhis batman is hardly an imposing figure . \\nchris o\\'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . \\nthe film\\'s one saving grace ? \\nundoubtably uma thurman\\'s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy . \\nher work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film . \\nms . thurman\\'s comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully . \\n ( i\\'m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey\\'s performance in batman forever . ) \\nher amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she\\'s offscreen the film greatly suffers . \\ni figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn\\'t a half-bad way to go . \\nwhile batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat . \\nit\\'s been a long time since i\\'ve laughed so much at a movie . \\n \" at \" , of course , is the operative word . \\n', b'when 17 year old beau hall ( jonathan tucker , \" the virgin suicides \" ) gets in a car accident after drinking with his 30 year old companion , club owner darby reese ( josh lucas , \" session 9 \" ) , his mom , margaret ( tilda swinton , \" the war zone \" ) pays reese a visit to convince him to leave her son alone . \\ninstead , reese travels out to their lake tahoe home and lures beau out to the boat house where beau learns that his mother was right about reese . \\nthe next morning margaret discovers darby\\'s dead body on their beach and , suspecting the worst , weights it down in a distant part of the lake . \\nbut her troubles are just beginning , as she soon learns with the arrival of blackmailer alek spera ( goran visnjic , \" practical magic \" ) in \" the deep end . \" \\nthe incredibly pale , red-headed scottish actress swinton immerses herself into the role of the reserved american super-mom whose life revolves around serving the needs of her three children and live-in father-in-law jack ( peter donat , \" the game \" ) . \\nshe shows great strength while allowing other emotions to glimmer through - discomfort at challenging reese in his gay disco ( named the deep end ) , near panic at having to dive down to his body to retrieve car keys , or even wry humor when an attempt to get help from jack becomes hopelessly miscommunicated . \\ngradually her loneliness becomes apparent ( her husband\\'s a naval officer , usually away at sea ) when her attempts to email him her concerns about beau are deleted and later , when a most unusual , yet chaste , romance turns tragic . \\nit\\'s a terrific performance . \\nthe stendahl syndrome-like script , adapted from elisabeth sanxay holding\\'s 40\\'s noir novel \\'the blank wall\\' by directors scott mcgehee and david siegel , would be unbelievable if not for swinton and her costar visnjic . \\nalek spera is a wrong side of the tracks loser who arrives after reese\\'s body has been discovered . \\nhe shows margaret a videotape of beau having sex with reese and demands $50 , 000 or he\\'ll turn the tape over to the reno police . \\nsubsequent visits will turn his mind set upside down and backwards , though , as he comes to admire and even love the woman he set out to blackmail . \\nthere\\'s yet another problem , though - his partner nagle ( raymond barry , \" dead man walking \" ) is a harder cored criminal who won\\'t let up until his share of the money is delivered . \\nvisnjic\\'s dark , brooding turn has an interior shading to it that makes us believe he\\'s a victim of circumstance and environment . \\nhis turnaround is palpable as he witnesses margaret\\'s inherent decency and her workaday surroundings . \\nalso outstanding is tucker as beau , who has a terrific character arc and pas de deux with his mother . \\ninitially beau\\'s the typical sullen teen . \\n\\'you\\'re blowing this out of proportion , \\' he says of her concerns about reese , not comprehending that his mom has enough insight to have divined the true nature of the relationship . \\nas his mom gets in deeper and deeper trying to cover up a crime he didn\\'t commit , beau becomes suspicious of her actions and apparent new companion , turning tables . \\nhis early black eye becomes her later split lip . \\nwhile the two can never be completely honest with each other , their love for each other comes through strongly . \\nthe directors ( \" suture \" ) have a firm grip on their material and cast . \\nthe story builds perfectly with bold strokes amidst a myriad of subtler underpinnings . \\nwater imagery is constant ( an early shot of weirdly rushing green is revealed to be a young boy cleaning out an aquarium ) . \\ngiles nuttgens ( \" fire \" ) cinematography , which won the 2001 sundance festival award , is crisp and startlingly clear . \\nthe tahoe locations and production design by kelly mcgehee and christopher tandon provide a dual personality for the film , contrasting the calm , well off existence of the lake against the gambling city of reno . \\n \" the deep end \" is a complex story of domino deeds and shifting relationships . \\ntake the plunge . \\n', b'there have been merchant-ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than \" the mod squad , \" a self-consciously \" hip \" cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby-boomers . \\nwell , said \" squad \" certainly won\\'t be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else , maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards . \\na contemporary take on this decidedly \\'70s show doesn\\'t exactly seem unwarranted , but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didn\\'t transform into a full-blown case of botulism . \\nhow curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad , insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time . \\nthey are julie , pete and linc , reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd ( exposition put out of the way so fast that you\\'re likely to be lost from the opening moments on ) , and they are respectively played by claire danes , giovanni ribisi and omar epps , talented actors each deserving of better than this . \\ntheir plight involves standard cop-corruption stuff , as our would-be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover-up after their superior ( reliable dennis farina , one of the best things here and gone so quickly ) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking . \\nthey pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others . \\nwhen you\\'re supposed to be asking , \" what\\'s going to happen next ? \" , \\nyou\\'ll instead entertain thoughts like \" who are these people and why should i care ? \" \\nor \" aren\\'t thrillers supposed to contain thrills ? \" \\nnot that danes , epps and ribisi don\\'t give it a shot . \\ndanes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep , as evidenced by \" my so-called life , \" but she\\'s saddled with a mysterious-boyfriend ( josh brolin ) subplot so see-through you begin to seriously question her so-called intelligence . \\nditto for ribisi\\'s ( \" saving private ryan \" ) looney loose cannon , though at least he performs with a wild-and-crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention . \\nbut epps - poor epps . \\nepps ( \" higher learning \" ) is so short-changed he\\'s reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him . \\nall this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters , one of whom , scott silver , is also the director . \\nthey must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings ( the look of the film is really quite impressive ) , it\\'ll somehow pay off , but this \" mod squad \" plods anyway . \\ncharacters are non-existent ; present are just some good-looking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes . \\nplot hardly escapes confusing convention . \\nand the one genre element you\\'d think would be show up in generous portions - a few nifty explosions , some fights , any kind of action whatsoever - only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest . \\nall those quick to put down last month\\'s inept but serviceable \" my favorite martian \" update need to take a step back . \\nhere\\'s a small-to-big-screen translation that really should\\'ve stayed in its former incarnation , \" mod \" or not . \\n', b'everybody in this film\\'s thinking of alicia . \\nno , this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the \" cryin\\' \" video . \\nthis is one of those erotic thrillers , but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed . \\nfirst off , there\\'s zero sex , almost no nudity , and it\\'s not as well-plotted as one of those tweed flicks . \\nwell , anyway . \\nthe \" plot . \" \\nalicia plays , well , the babysitter , who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents ( j . t . \\nwalsh and lee garlington ) go out to a party . \\nthe film , trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers , shows every characters\\' thoughts , except alicia\\'s . \\nthe thing is alicia\\'s in most of them in most cases , and the thoughts aren\\'t too kosher . \\nfirst off , there\\'s her boyfriend ( jeremy london , who gave one of the all-time lousy performances in \" mallrats , \" and is only a notch better here ) , who\\'s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully , played by nicky katt from \" suburbia \" ( who shows he\\'s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again ) . \\nthey decide they want to crash her babysitting job , looking for the typical babysitting hanky-panky . \\nsomethine like that . \\nthe film intercuts between the subplots ( alicia babysitting , nicky and jeremy , the party ) and each characters\\' thoughts . \\nwe get to see jeremy and nicky\\'s dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia , j . t . \\nthinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub ( she has it all covered up , the little tease ) , and , worst of all , lee garlington dreaming of that hunk , george segal . \\nit even shows them in bed together . \\nyea . \\ni so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i\\'m used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in \" flirting with disaster . \" \\nthe ending is some kind of big tragedy thing , but come on . \\nlike we care about any of the characters . \\nthe only interesting one is alicia , mainly because she\\'s alicia , and we mostly see her in the fantasies . \\nso i guess she\\'s some kind of mystery or something . \\nbut she is never explored further . \\nso , basically , this film is just a series of mastabatory images , sometimes featuring a non-nude alicia ( once again , sadly ) , sometimes featuring a scantily-clad george segal ( once again , sadly ) . \\ni watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the only way to watch this film . \\ni mean , there\\'s a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night : they\\'re just as good as sleeping pills . \\nand this one is one big fat waste of time , even for an alicia film . \\n', b'according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors \" hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness . \" \\nhmm . \\nyou never know , they just might be on to something . \\nwhat with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own . \\nbut then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it . \\nit\\'s cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch . \\nthat\\'s a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more . \\nwoody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson . \\nthe movie opens in the fifties with roy\\'s dad dishing out the reader\\'s digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever . \\nthe sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken . \\nit\\'s thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy . \\nmccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy\\'s hand . \\nthen it\\'s fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand . \\nhe\\'s hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege . \\nso together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way . \\nwith the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that\\'s . . . \\ndumb and dumber . \\nyes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle . \\nso , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen . \\nget set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking . \\nnow , don\\'t get me wrong , there\\'s nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy . \\nthe trouble is that these jokes aren\\'t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction . \\nit lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together . \\nsome gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don\\'t do anything . \\nwhy the long , unfunny fight in the car park ? \\nwhy two of these ? \\nwhy does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ? \\nthe film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , \" wouldn\\'t that be funny ? \" . \\nwell , no , actually . \\nthe actors don\\'t do the movie much favours either . \\nwoody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . . please \\n ) . \\neven murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie\\'s climax . \\nall in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no-hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance . \\nwe\\'ll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( \" strictly bowling \" , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n', b'they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie\\'s poster : \" no sequel . \" \\nscary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor , and it is not because the wayans brothers , shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera , don\\'t try . \\nwhat defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof . \\nthe first movie - an outrageous , low-brow , savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer - succeeded because of its take-no-prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue , familiar and popular . \\nin scary movie 2 , the filmmakers take on the haunted house-ghost story format which , if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill , did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series . \\nscary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist , featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn . \\nof course split pea soup is the punch line - an overabundant amount , which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive . \\nbut this pre-credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action , which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project . \\nsome of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original , but they lack that take-no-prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque . \\nscary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another , offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball , and the films what lies beneath and hannibal ( features that only faired adequately at the box office ) , john woo\\'s mission : impossible 2 and charlie\\'s angels . \\nit is as if the wayans and their team of writers - at least seven are credited - just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they\\'d coalesce . \\nthey don\\'t . \\nwhile the pace of the original left you breathless , the sequel moves with the speed of an 18-wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road . \\nyou can almost hear the reels panting . \\nscary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original , but it falls very short . \\nit\\'s a dissatisfying spectacle , a very weak sister of a very good movie . \\nthe really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is . \\n', b\"in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking . \\nthe hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone . \\nthe cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble . \\nall chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element . \\nthe duo must always be completely mismatched . \\nthe hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone . \\nhowever , that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film . \\nrush hour is jackie chan's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) . \\nproving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before . \\nstill , some die-hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) . \\nthis film takes a familiar theme of east meets west . \\njackie chan is lee , the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case , while chris tucker is carter , the loudmouthed , destructive cop that is `promoted' to the fbi to help him . \\nor , at least , so he thinks ( also another classic notion in action films : the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes ) . \\ndespite the necessary conventions of action films , rush hour is some of the most fun you'll spend and hour and forty minutes watching . \\njackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen , continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches . \\nchris tucker , familiar from his whiny , annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable , complementing jackie chan's straight-laced character . \\nhowever , jackie chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge , as expected of him and his films . \\nperfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing into american culture , he makes up for the down time his character experiences . \\nwhen he is in action , however , you'll be amused and dazzled . \\nstill being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case , a steering wheel , a serving tray , and a barstool ) , jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu . \\nchris tucker's character may come across as irritating , yet is also humorous . \\nsince he's not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan , he uses his main weapon : his mouth ( hence , the tagline , `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west' ) . \\nwhile dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare , it is appropriate for the film and still very funny . \\nwhile not necessarily poignant , attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well . \\nlee's `knowledge' of american pop culture ( `that's the beach boys ! ' ) \\nwhen contrasted against carter's lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick , while carter teaches lee hip-hop dance moves . \\nwhile rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy . \\nwith its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs , it makes for a fun film . \\nas well , it is a true departure from jackie chan films , as it is missing one common element : a whiny female co-star . \\n\", b'confucius once said , \" governing a nation is like cooking a small fish -- don\\'t overdo it . \" \\nhis maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make . \\ngranted , mike judge , writer-director of the workplace satire office space isn\\'t exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series \" beavis and butt-head \" was pure gold for its network ) . \\nbut unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground . \\nthe iffiness in judge\\'s plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal . \\nin fact , based on the popularity of scott adams\\' cartoon \" dilbert , \" which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood . \\nunfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of \" saturday night live \" rather than a full-length feature . \\nthe most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie\\'s top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated . \\nother evidence of office space\\'s failure to work are its lack of good jokes . \\nthe comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud . \\nthe material in the movie is on-key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here . \\nhowever , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse . \\nthe plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech . \\nafter the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of \" downsizing \" the company\\'s payroll . \\nwhen peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) \\'s stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall . \\nthe circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but . \\na sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it\\'s definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent . \\n', b'susan granger\\'s review of \" jeepers creepers \" ( mgm/ua entertainment ) \\nthis nasty , little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a drainage pipe . \\nwhen long decides to investigate , there\\'s nothing but trouble . \\n \" you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ? \\n- well , this is it ! \" \\nphilips warns . \\nwhat he finds in the basement of an old , abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying , jagged-stitched incision from his neck to his navel , plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies , stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry . \\nlong flees but now the monstrous , winged creeper ( jonathan breck ) is after both of them ! \\neileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle , a psychic who explains the evil creature\\'s bizarre feeding habits . \\non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" jeepers creepers \" is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion , giving new meaning to the old song \" jeepers creepers . \" \\nand now - as paul harvey would say - for the rest of the story . \\nwhat\\'s more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer/director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year-old actor in california . \\nsentenced to three years in prison , he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 . \\nwhen salva made \" powder \" ( 1995 ) , the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities , disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile . \\nand now , once again , in this mgm/ua film , that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio . \\n', b'wolfgang petersen\\'s latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple . \\nit only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it\\'s going to hurt ? quite a bit . \\nok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here\\'s my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn\\'t really much of a story to tell . \\nbasically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of \" the storm of the century . \" \\nhow much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? \\nnot nearly enough . \\nso he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous . \\naudiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel . \\nthe last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters . \\ni have yet to read sebastian junger\\'s the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale . \\nbased on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak . \\nusing a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality . \\nright away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who\\'s always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . \\nso many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer . \\nit is not the all-star cast\\'s fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal . \\nallen payne\\'s character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he\\'s never given any lines ! \\nare we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? \\nfichtner\\'s character is terribly underdeveloped - we don\\'t know what he\\'s doing there , where he\\'s from , or who he\\'s supposed to be . \\nthe remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene \" you know what would look good on you ? \\nme ! \" \\nooooh real creative ) . \\nas the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human . \\nonly when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk . \\nthe computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real . \\ni can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again . \\nthis is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film . \\nthe perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment . \\nthe maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so . \\ni guess i\\'ll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ? \\n', b\"this is the worst movie i've viewed so far in 98 . \\nthe avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil , sir august de wynter wearing kilt . \\nthe question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast ? \\nthe same question was probably asked of last year's stinker batman and robin . \\ni feel the production got a little too smug , the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie . \\nmy greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed ( thurman and fiennes ) ? something that was a vital element of the 60's tv serial of the same name . \\nthe dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks , but does not allow much room for character development and interaction , except to perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves . \\none wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality . \\nconnery as sir august , does not fair better than thurman or fiennes . \\nhis dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather , mostly embarrassing and poor quality . \\nif there is a movie you would prefer never to see , i believe the avengers would be a good choice . \\nfor one thing , you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title . \\ni cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released , but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature , like lightning you can't see it coming until it hits you . \\n\", b'romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant . \\nwith director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . \\nthose mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay . \\ncall me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don\\'t seem to mix well . \\ngary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . \\nhis cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn\\'t provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character . \\njack has become addicted to \" feeding the hole \" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . \\nwhen he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . \\ngary oldman\\'s performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored . \\nin the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider . \\ndemarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world . \\nthis character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can\\'t remember seeing a character quite like her . \\nafter being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety . \\nwhat a woman ! \\nlena olin\\'s performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film . \\nanabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo\\'s wife . \\nthere is little insight into her character . \\nshe\\'s depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house . \\njuliette lewis , as romeo\\'s girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis\\' portrayal certainly didn\\'t improve it . \\nboth women were anything but sexy or attractive . \\npoorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems . \\nit is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something . \\nfor example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene . \\nfine . \\njack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite . \\nfine . \\nwhat does jack proceed to do ? \\nhe brushes his friends off by telling them he isn\\'t feeling well , then strolls over to the boss . \\nwhy ? \\nthe boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack\\'s toes by the gravesite . \\ni guess they weren\\'t worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . . \\nor here\\'s another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw . \\nshe proceeded to set the place on fire . \\nwouldn\\'t the flames burn off the fingerprints ? \\naren\\'t dental records more important ? \\nas bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn\\'t she come up with a better plot ? \\n ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . ) \\nlack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film . \\nthis film doesn\\'t even add up the large details . \\nthere is little or no consistency in the story-line . \\nnot much makes sense . \\nthe direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable . \\nthe moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one . \\nso while it certainly isn\\'t reservoir dogs , it certainly isn\\'t diva . \\nthere\\'s plenty more to tear apart in this film . \\nmy advice to someone who hasn\\'t seen it to to wait until it comes on video . \\nthere are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously . \\nit\\'s not a boring film , just not a good one . \\nor an intelligent one . \\n', b'matthew broderick and high school comedy . \\nthe two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 . \\nnow it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world . \\nferris buehler\\'s day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows . \\nit was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean . \\nbut election is far different . \\nthis production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well . \\njim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud . \\nhe is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school . \\nin turn , carver high school has provided a home for him . \\njim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body . \\ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , \" super nice \" young girl . \\nshe is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body . \\nso , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president . \\nthe metzler family is an extremely wealthy one . \\nthe father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company . \\nthe mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife . \\nand the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school . \\npaul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school . \\ntammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery . \\nfor reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president . \\nhe claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts . \\nso paul agrees and the race is on . \\nbut then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well . \\nher campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing . \\nwell , \" i don\\'t even want to go to college , \" she says . \\nin election , there are no \" good guys \" . \\nalmost everyone has their own agenda . \\nno matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience . \\ntracy is the type of person that you remember from high school . \\nshe is the girl that would be labeled \" most likely to achieve anything she wants \" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that . \\njim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage . \\neveryone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul\\'s girlfriend are two sided characters . \\nthat is much of this film\\'s beauty , it doesn\\'t have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves . \\nmatthew broderick couldn\\'t have been any more perfect for this role . \\nhis character is often similar bill murray\\'s award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore . \\nof the two acting jobs , broderick\\'s is far superior . \\nbut even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon . \\nthe hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable . \\nbroderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes . \\none such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day . \\nyou can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate . \\nand his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face . \\nthe supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience . \\nbut that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part . \\nhowever , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl . \\nthis is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency . \\nshe is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed . \\nif ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal . \\nbut don\\'t you dare think that election\\'s goals are similar . \\nit is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world . \\nthere certainly is no pile of marshmallows here . \\n', b\"expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) . \\nroger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film . \\ni read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it . \\nthe opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter . \\nthe landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) . \\none can almost sense the cold . \\nbut the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better . \\nthis is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots . \\nthe movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true . \\nthis chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed . \\nin the plane three men find ? the american dream . . . \\nin a gym bag . ? \\naffliction too was set in a snowy landscape . \\nit really seems very simple . \\njust hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true . \\nbut the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes . \\nas in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing . \\nbut doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish . \\nthe movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense . \\ni have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger . \\nthe biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story . \\nthe writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book . \\nthis is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author . \\nthe movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense . \\ni'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what . \\neven a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included . \\nthe man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many . \\nturns out . . . \\nwell , see the movie . \\none should be warned against seeing the trailer . \\nit reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning . \\nbut much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you're lucky , you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie . \\n\", b'naturally , at the core of leon gast\\'s \" when we were kings \" is the fight itself , for what a fight it was . \\nthanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman . \\nfans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore . \\nwith the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life . \\nbut \" when we were kings \" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match . \\nquestions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary . \\ngast could hardly choose otherwise , considering the vocal , uncompromising politics of muhammad ali . \\na member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast\\'s film with a forceful swipe at the united states . \\nwhen ali hollers \" damn america\\' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind . \\nhis decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : \" no viet cong ever called me nigger \" , ali reasons . \\ndespite showcasing ali\\'s proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of \" when we were kings \" is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion . \\nlistening to the film\\'s numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this \" rumble in the jungle \" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map . \\nspike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a \" coming home \" to africa . \\nforeman reminds us that africa is the \" cradle of civilisation \" . \\nfair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality . \\nit is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator . \\nwhile ali respects mobutu\\'s ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well-stocked torture chambers . \\nmailer\\'s insights are lost on most of the film\\'s commentators . \\ngeorge plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire . \\nwith admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire\\' s squalid ruling elite . \\nmobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power . \\ndon king , resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the \" messiah \" label attributed to him by a loyal disciple , passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity . \\nunderstandably , foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal . \\nhe may be , as one sympathiser notes , \" blacker \" than ali , but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali , the thuggish mobutu , and the tacky huckster don king . \\nafrica , zaire , inspirational leader or vicious dictator , all is left undifferentiated , unconsidered , in this optimistic celebration of black unity . \\nlittle wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali\\'s opponent wasn\\'t white . \\nadmittedly , these issues are only hinted at , rather than substantially explored . \\nthe audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves , in their own time . \\nthere is just too much to cover , too much that is truly worthy of celebration , for a protracted political analysis to be justified . \\nthe excitement of james brown and b . b king in concert , for instance . \\nand of course there\\'s always ali to consider , as he shamelessly , and hilariously , hams it up in front of the camera , shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another - \" we gonna get it on coz we don\\'t get along ! \" . \\ndoubtlessly , considering the multi-faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover , the makers of \" when we were kings \" faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues , and what personalities , best deserved their attention . \\nfortunately , by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter , they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event . \\n', b'pitch black is a sheep in wolf\\'s clothing . \\nit is full of darkness , danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype , an unsettling and scary film going experience . \\ndon\\'t be fooled . \\npitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare-fest . \\nit starts off with blistering intensity . \\na cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns . \\namong the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship\\'s pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely . \\nthere is imam ( david ) , an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film . \\nthere is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns ( hauser ) , who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal . \\nand there is riddick ( diesel ) , a menacing , muscle-bound convicted murderer who\\'s being brought back to justice by johns . \\nthe group quickly sizes up the situation and each other . \\nconfident in their assessment of matters , a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment . \\nthose plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet\\'s wildlife , a predatory , sometimes winged , species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh . \\nfortunately , the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet\\'s surface . \\nunfortunately , the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur , taking away their one protection from the monsters . \\nthe group\\'s savior comes in the form of johns , whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory . \\nor does it ? \\npitch black deviates from the standard sci-fi fare by avoiding some of the stock \" escape the boogieman \" conflicts the genre typically serves up . \\njust as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false . \\nthe excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth . \\na recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations . \\ni found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist . \\nconversely , imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah . \\none by one , his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed . \\nimam is forced to reassess his faith . \\nanother character expresses belief in god , along with a life long hate . \\nyet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group . \\nit is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick . \\nspecial mention should be made of vin diesel , who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence . \\nhis character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine , but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick . \\nthey can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger-like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel\\'s mouth . \\nthe movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked . \\nthe creatures do look derivative of the ones in alien . \\nthe dialogue isn\\'t the freshest at times , reminiscent of a bad comic book . \\nyes , the appearance of riddick\\'s vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation . \\nthese trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell . \\ntwohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman , but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives . \\n', b'everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap , from the roger corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign ( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi : the undiscovered country ) . \\nbut piller\\'s not-quite-half-baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection\\'s failure . \\ni\\'m about to give the same advice to rick berman and co . \\nas i\\'ve given to the financiers of james bond movies : it\\'s time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director . \\n ( while we\\'re at it , put that visor back on laforge ! ) \\nfor three hundred years , the ba\\'ku species ( who look just like humans ) have lived on a ringed-planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth . \\nsix hundred of them occupy the briar patch , the area affected by metaphasic radition , a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly . \\nbut evil ru\\'afo ( this is probably abraham\\'s last stop before performing \" amadeus \" at a dinner theatre near you ) , leader of the son\\'a ( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery ) , wants to relocate the ba\\'ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place , in order to replenish his dying breed . \\nthe federation is all for this , but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive : to not interfere with the development of an alien race . \\n ( never mind that the ba\\'ku didn\\'t exactly evolve-they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world . ) \\nevery time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment . \\nhe has called it a comedy , a thinking man\\'s picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western . \\n ( i presume that\\'s some john ford he went to school with , not the director of the searchers . ) \\nhe has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version . \\nthat\\'s no excuse-someone generated this footage . \\nmuddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia . \\nconsider such curiosities . . . \\npicard\\'s love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) -her scientific explanation for this ? \\n \" don\\'t ask . \" \\nworf gets a pimple ( he\\'s re-experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time-defying atmosphere ) , laforge regains his eyesight ( trust me , levar burton\\'s real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact ) and troi brags about her firm boobs , but picard remains as bald as an android\\'s butt . \\nmost suspiciously , what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun ? \\nthe filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts , and they also turn ru\\'afo into a completely power-mad superfreak , just so the characters will have something to do in the climax . \\n ( and if you\\'ve seen return of the jedi , you\\'ve seen the ending of this movie . ) \\ndidn\\'t picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions ? \\nfrakes lucked out with first contact , and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection : he has no sense of comic timing , and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists . \\n ( take a look at the painful \" troi gets drunk \" scene in fc and you\\'ll get the general idea of insurrection\\'s unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone . ) \\neven the worst shatner and co . \\ntreks , like the final frontier , maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless , charming comaraderie between kirk , spock , and bones . \\nneither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher ( gates mcfadden , whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique ) , troi , or laforge . \\nand all three next generation films spend too much time on data , who is the franchise\\'s answer to urkel . \\nneed a cheap laugh ? \\nhave data say something sexual , or start singing , or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it\\'s the hunk of styrofoam it really is . \\nhere\\'s my proposed title for number 10 : data star data trek : data data data data data . \\nin this movie , data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose , while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation . \\nstar trek : insurrection had one nice , eerie , silent moment that hints at a better , darker film . \\ni\\'m not saying all of them should be star trek ii : the wrath of khan , but this one boldly went where no movie should go again . \\n', b'perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with \" . . . this is the fake news , \" norm macdonald , at times , could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi-offensive phrases in his raspy voice , coated with a condescending attitude . \\nhis shtick was marked by crassness . \\nin this movie , for example , when his girlfriend says that she\\'s kicking him out because he\\'s been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months , he tries to calm the situation by saying , \" maybe you\\'ll feel better after we have some dirty sex . \" \\nthis kind of humor can only go so far , but certainly can\\'t go the distance in a full-length feature . \\n \" dirty work \" , is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically . \\nemotionally , they\\'ve never outgrown their pubescent years , which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback . \\nalthough having no apparent real world skills , the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people . \\nif the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket , then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart . \\nmitch ( norm macdonald ) and sam ( artie lange ) need to come up with $50 , 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam\\'s dad ( jack warden ) can have a heart operation . \\ntheir idea is to start a revenge-for-hire business where they\\'ll do your dirty work . \\nin the funniest scene ( and possibly the only funny scene ) of the movie , they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot . \\ntheir presence is established , but when a less-than-honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment , the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge . \\nby default , dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots , but it delivers jerky boys level material . \\nexcept for the bit at the used car lot ( and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers ) , the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call . \\nalready weak on material , it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs \\'broads\\' and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction . \\nbut what\\'s really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor . \\nrelying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying \" note to self \" ( \" note to self : learn to fight , \" he says after getting beat up ; \" note to self : there\\'s always beer , \" he says after hitting rock bottom ; etc . ) , we feel like we\\'re just watching an elongated rehash of his not-so-glorious days on saturday night live . \\nmuch like the television show , for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits . \\nthe rest of the story is just dead space . \\n', b'bruce willis is a type-casted actor . \\nin die hard , he played john mcclaine , a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time . \\nagain , in pulp fiction , as butch coolidge , an over-the-hill boxer , he steps on the wrong guys toes . \\nin luc besson\\'s the fifth element , willis plays korben dallas , a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time . \\na stylish science fiction epic , the fifth element\\'s complex plot begins right away , in the deserts of egypt ( think stargate ) in 1914 . \\nan enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the \" 5 elements \" are stored and takes them away , vowing to return them when the evil comes back . \\ncut to present day , which is our future . \\nthe year is 2023 , and new york is the city . \\nthe only basic differences between besson\\'s futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker , the buildings are higher , and the traffic floats ! \\nanyway , the \" evil \" comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth , so back come the tortoise-like aliens to return the \" 5 elements \" to earth , in order to defend themselves against the \" evil . \" \\nin the process , however , the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing . \\nwhen officials arrive at the site , all that remains is a hand . \\nwhat can you do with a hand ? \\nhey , its the 21st century here-dna reconstruction ! \\nthis hand turns out to belong to a beautiful , but mysterious woman named leeloo ( milla jovovich , dazed and confused ) . \\nshe escapes and , attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korben\\'s floating cab . \\nit\\'s love at first site , as korben and leeloo elude the lazy-as-always cops . \\nwhen leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ( ian holm , night falls on manhattan ) , korben searches the \" yellow pages \" and delivers her to the door of the good reverend , the only man who knows of her background and duties . \\nnow , korben , leeloo , and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship ( special effects were spectacular here ) to find the remaining four elements . \\nit is here , where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg ( gary oldman , murder in the first ) . \\nhe , too , wants possession of the elements , as do a group of pig-like warriors ( think the gamorreans in return of the jedi ) . \\nin a spectacular ending , with time running out , leeloo is faced with a problem-why should she save a people who live to destroy each other ? \\nthe question is a good one , and one that could be pondered . \\nbut enough of that . \\nwhen korben points out his love for her , leeloo is inclined to become the \" 5th element \" and save the world from total destruction . \\nthe fifth element features good performances by willis and holm , an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain ( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson\\'s the joker in batman ) by one of the masters of villainy , oldman , and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich . \\nthe supporting cast , which includes brion james ( tango & cash ) , tim \" tiny \" lester ( no holds barred ) , luke perry ( buffy the vampire slayer ) , and chris tucker ( friday ) , added a comedic effect to the film . \\nalthough besson\\'s the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches , it is a solid motion picture with a definite point . \\nsome other directors ( like anaconda\\'s luis llosa ) should take a lesson from this guy-using ideas from epic motion pictures the right way . \\nideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film . \\nsci-fi fan or not , any movie-lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture . \\n , \\n', b'as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable . \\nwith a total of 4 decent films , it\\'s not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing . \\nwith that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on \" the 13th warrior \" will be . \\nthe film is based on the michael crichton \" eaters of the dead \" , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king . \\nafter tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog . \\nso , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen . \\nso far it sounds interesting right ? \\nnot when all of this takes place in 15 minutes . \\nafter that , they basically run around killing . \\nthat alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it . \\nobviously that\\'s not the case here . \\neven if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed . \\nsince all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work . \\ncan\\'t the camera men sit still ? \\ni\\'d like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well . \\nthe film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you\\'re eating . \\nwith corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there\\'s basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs . \\nthat\\'s the only thing that honestly caught my interest . \\nwhen i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ? \\nwell now i know . \\ncrichton\\'s greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement . \\nwhat\\'s there to argue about anyway ? \\nthe film couldn\\'t be saved , no matter how much they spent or casted . \\nseeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn\\'t be surprised to see \" the 13th warrior \" become a hit . \\nplease do me a favor and save your money at all costs , or else you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself . \\n', b'all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \\nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996\\'s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante\\'s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \\nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \\nno number of name changes can help this picture . \\nit\\'s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \\nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \\nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \\nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \\nfrom that moment on , it\\'s all downhill . \\nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \\nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \\nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \\nthere\\'s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \\nit\\'s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren\\'t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \\nthe film\\'s conclusion is so preposterous that it\\'s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \\naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \\ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \\nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \\nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \\nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \\nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \\nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \\nthere\\'s tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \\nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv\\'s \" lou grant \" ) , get stuck on a street that\\'s rapidly turning into a river . \\na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \\nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \\nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg\\'s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \\nthere isn\\'t any real acting in this film . \\nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \\ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \\nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \\nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \\nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \\nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn\\'t trust nature\\'s fury as the chief engine of conflict . \\nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \\ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \\nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \\nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \\nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \\n', b'synopsis : in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels . \\nthere is an overarching galactic united nations-type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor . \\nwithin the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering , isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation . \\npreserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth . \\nmanipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous , reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith , so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a \" phantom \" menace . \\njedi knight qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala\\'s home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ( ahmed best ) . \\non the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natalie portman ) attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \\nthe five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place . \\ncan they free amidala\\'s helpless planet ? \\nopinion : on tv last night i watched young , wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras , gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace\\'s greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television . \\ngiven this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace , the most anticipated movie of 1999 , could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it . \\ndoes phantom menace match the exaggerated hype ? \\ndirector george lucas answers , \" it\\'s only a movie . \" \\nto me , any movie with russian-sounding accents for bad guys , jamaican accents for good guys , and middle eastern-sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound . \\nvisually , star wars : episode i --the phantom menace ( 1999 ) is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child-friendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue ( mostly geopolitics ) is beyond the level of children . \\nit is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation : droid origins , family lineage , the definitions of terms like blockade , appeasement , federation , alliance , symbiosis , satellite-controlled robots et cetera . \\nat least this much is clear : there\\'s plenty of eye candy , and in the last few minutes it\\'s good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped , horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes . \\nweaknesses : weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance . \\nat first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story , but then phantom takes an hour-long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme . \\nthis dilutes the central story . \\nadditionally , smaller scenes seem written self consciously , as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie . \\nveteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads . \\nbetter ensemble chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances and storytelling punch . \\nstrengths : on the bright side phantom menace as a big-budget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures , worlds and vehicles appear real . \\nthe film boasts sophisticated , top-of-the-line visuals and quality exotic costumes , a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone , and three worthwhile sequences in the second half . \\nbottom line ? \\nseeing the film is entertaining and informative , like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots . \\nwe are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity , music and tie-ins for the next few months . \\n', b'the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . \\nthe rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that\\'s exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . \\nlast year\\'s speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year\\'s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . \\nin some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . \\nwhatever uniqueness the original might\\'ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . \\njulie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . \\njulie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . \\nwill and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . \\nunfortunately , things aren\\'t so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . \\nit\\'s another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . \\nthere\\'s not much that\\'s original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it\\'s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . \\nfor die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . \\nthe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn\\'t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . \\nthe man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . \\nmuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . \\nthe whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . \\nand , whereas the killer\\'s identity might\\'ve been a question in the first movie , it\\'s almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . \\nthree or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as \" the killer . \" \\nthey\\'re almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . \\nand so , in the end , it\\'s left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . \\ngod help us . \\n', b'sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw ? \\nyup , it\\'s gotta be summer . \\njust when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and direct-to-video releases , into port slams speed 2 : cruise control , the gloriously godawful follow-up to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed . \\nthe gimmick , this time , is an ocean liner rigged to , well , crash into stuff . \\nsound exciting ? \\ndennis hopper\\'s disgruntled bomb squader , the villain of the first film , has given way to willem dafoe\\'s disgruntled computer programmer , a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to use live leeches , i kid you not , as a self-treatment for copper poison- ing . \\n ( and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro- magnetic fields , no less ! \\ncalling dean edell . . . ) \\nso , he overrides the boat\\'s computer , convinces the crew to abandon ship , and sends the remaining passengers , those who couldn\\'t evacuate in time , on a col- lision course with destiny . \\n ( oddly , no one thinks to just . . . \\njump off the back of the boat . ) \\nwith keanu reeves electing not to return-- perhaps he read the script ? -- \\nthe job of john mcclane goes to jason patric ( sleepers ) , as the * second * la cop and swat team member that that bus drivin\\' babe annie ( bullock ) has dated . \\n ( what are the odds ? ) \\nthey\\'re on this caribbean cruise for pleasure , as are a handful of requisite stock characters , including a deaf teenager ( ! ) who has a crush on the hero ( ! ! ) who also knows how to sign ( ! ! ! ) . \\n ( and you thought the raptor slam was a cool summer movie move ? \\nwait till you see the feats that * this * little girl can do , when stuck on a shipboard elevator ! ) \\nbullock is her pesky , perky self , though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests . \\n ( those paying attention to her bikini- and tank- tops probably won\\'t complain , however ) patric is the main man in motion and that\\'s damn good , \\'cause when he stops to talk , he\\'s only slightly less monotone than his predecessor . \\n ( his first lol line is to ms . bullock : \" i\\'d like to boogie with you . \" ) \\nof course , nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves quite the way that returning director jan de bont does . \\nhe also produced this mess , which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards . \\n ( con air , buddy , father\\'s day , romy and michelle\\'s high school reunion , murder at 1600 , 8 heads in a duffle bag , anaconda , vegas vacation , meet wally sparks , metro , bevery hills ninja , the relic , all is forgiven ) . \\nworse , he\\'s spent a hundred mil on a premise that doesn\\'t even live up to its title ! \\nthere\\'s no sweat-inducing motion of the ocean here-- just two hours of shaky handheld camera work and a handful of cross-cut exteriors , all leading up to the big slam , when the love boat sideswipes an oil tanker and then plows into a harbor town . \\n ( oh , how far we\\'ve come in twenty years . \\nremember the simple fun of seeing a locomotive smash into railway station in the silver streak ? ) \\nadmittedly , either of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price of admission . \\nit\\'s just the rest of the movie-- the other hundred or so minutes-- that\\'s pure nonsense . \\nand wonderful nonsense at that . \\ni know he didn\\'t intend to , but de bont has done one thing right : he\\'s created the hands-down funniest film of the year . \\nso , now , allow to present a few more things that made me laugh : \\no a box with a big label : \" fiber optic converter \" \\no plain english , whole-sentence computer instructions \\no an entire sequence devoted to opening a fire door \\no jason patric\\'s character walks onto the bridge and immediately understands everything that\\'s happening \\no a ships\\' navigator who speaks in a scottish accent and actually gets to say \" i canna override it ! \" \\no willem dafoe\\'s amazing arm-mounted keyboard \\no two living , breathing adults ( bullock\\'s character and the first mate ) who have to be told , step by step , how to disconnect a trip wire from the pin of a hand grenade . \\nduh \\no \" no wait ! \" \\nscreams the ship\\'s intercom \\no yet another damn dog in peril \\no fishing reel . \\npontoon plane . \\nmemories of weekend at bernie\\'s \\n', b\"it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office . \\na poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . \\nin directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie . \\nin addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types . \\nthe two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together . \\njackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts . \\nthe other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one . \\nchan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time . \\nchris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan's performance . \\nhe works perfectly with the script , and it's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines . \\nalmost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent . \\nwe're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd . \\ncut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters . \\nthe fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help . \\nthe fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective . \\nit's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up . \\nrattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year's grosse pointe blank . \\nthere are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback . \\nalso , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing . \\nhowever , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background . \\nalmost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it's tucker's toned-down routine or chan's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types . \\na recommendable visit to the theater , indeed . \\n\", b'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \\ni didn\\'t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . \\nthe movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . \\nmy real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) \\ni was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film . \\nit is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture . \\nfor those of you who don\\'t know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , \" a graduate of several 12-step programs . \" \\nstuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . \\nstuart\\'s relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d\\'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . \\nthen , disaster strikes . \\nstuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked . \\nhe is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up . \\nfranken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people . \\nalthough smalley\\'s dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy . \\nalso , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought . \\nalthough filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion . \\nfor a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called \" serious dramas \" of today . \\nall the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit . \\nif you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven\\'t seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out . \\nyou\\'ll laugh . . . you\\'ll \\ncry . . . . it\\'s \\nall there . \\n', b'the most absurd remake of 1998 ? \\nit\\'s a toss up between gus van sant\\'s psycho and mighty joe young , the new disney picture based on the old rko picture . \\n ( i knew i was in trouble when a polished , computer-generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . ) \\nthere is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie , period . \\n ( witness the quick deaths of buddy , born to be wild and congo . ) \\nand while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it\\'s also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it . \\ntheron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers . \\nthat baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers . \\nenter conservationist greg ( paxton ) , who convinces jill to move with joe to california , where they can protect him better in a controlled environment . \\njoe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a . , plotting joe\\'s demise . \\nsuffice it to say , the movie could have been called \" joe : ape in the city . \" \\ntheron ( so good in devil\\'s advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising . \\nthe plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg\\'s the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer-generated t-rex-i mean , joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , \" look , joe\\'s headed for the movie theatre ! \" \\nfollowed by a shot of joe scaling mann\\'s chinese theater ; a moment later , jill shouts again something like \" look , joe\\'s headed for an amusement park ! \" and what do you know , there\\'s joe at the pallisades carnival , scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers . \\nthe seams of last-minute edits to mighty joe young show-unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves . \\nthe movie sure feels uneven , regardless : act two is underdeveloped , while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long , long way . \\nunderwood ( tremors , speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful , untamed landscape looks dull in his hands . \\n ( capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style . ) \\ni did enjoy certain sequences , especially the demoliton of a black-tie dinner sequence ; and the prologue , however implausible , is touching . \\n ( as a tyke , joe acts just like e . t . ) rick baker\\'s make-up effects and puppetry are outstanding , the real star of the show-yet , for all its technical flawlessness , the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love . \\n ( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl . ) \\nto be fair , i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children-it\\'s a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue . \\nit\\'s certainly not a film for very young kids-intense fighting scenes may scare them , while any time joe\\'s not on camera may bore them to tears . \\n ( note : older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron\\'s colourful array of tank tops . ) \\ni suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing , but they sure don\\'t make ? em like they used to . \\n', b'ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his , or her , sophistication ? \\nit\\'s full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined . \\ni felt the same way watching drowning mona . \\nskip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy . \\nthere are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing . \\nthere is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n . y . , being a test town for the then new yugo . \\neveryone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates . \\neven the police chief drives one . \\nthere is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets . \\nthere also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred . \\nit pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends . \\nit turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend . \\nthere are some sight gags that pop up as well , such as mona\\'s tombstone , which reads \" demoted \" , instead of devoted . \\nstill , the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond . \\nthe lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona ( midler ) . \\neach scene with her is the same : scream at someone , hit someone , then scream some more . \\nthere\\'s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness . \\nanyone off the street could have played the role , such as it is . \\nthe other characters are walking cardboard cutouts . \\neach one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization . \\nthere is a burly , female car mechanic , so of course , there is a forced lesbianism gag . \\nmona\\'s son , jeff ( marcus thomas ) is a simpleton , hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth . \\nchief of police rash ( devito ) likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter . \\nthere\\'s nothing more to him . \\nelle , the chief\\'s daughter ( campbell ) , is bland personified , a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married . \\nmona\\'s husband phil ( fichtner ) jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch . \\nbob ( affleck ) , elle\\'s betrothed , and business partner to jeff , is a mumbling , obvious dullard . \\nthere is no contrast to any of the characters . \\nby having at least one character with some wit , or wits , to serve as counterpoint to the others , perhaps steinfeld\\'s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better . \\nostensibly a murder mystery , drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately , then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer , who could be anyone due to mona\\'s loving manner with everyone on town . \\neven that aspect of the film fails , throwing in a convenient , ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things . \\nit\\'s been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood . \\nwhat makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it\\'s ineptitude . \\n', b'so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \\nwell , whatever it is , you\\'d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we\\'re left with here . \\nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \\nit\\'s like i said . . . this \\nmovie sucks . \\nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \\ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \\nuneven , would be another . \\nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it\\'s actually going to go \" somewhere \" . \\nbut it isn\\'t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the \" pain \" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \\nin a sci-fi movie ? \\nwell , i don\\'t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \\nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their \" misadventures in space \" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \\nmind you , if you enjoyed that film\\'s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \\nof course , i don\\'t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \\nugh . \\nwhat a friggin\\' mess . \\nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \\ndidn\\'t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \\ndidn\\'t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain\\'t saying much ! ) . \\nof course , you can\\'t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o\\'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \\n\\'nuff said . \\nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film\\'s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \\nears hurt ! ) . \\nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \\nsure . \\ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn\\'t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the \" sand-twister \" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \\nother than that ? \\ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , \\ndid i say \" admire \" , i meant \" am disgusted \" ! \\nall in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it\\'s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \\ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \\nthere\\'s a great movie ! \\nand on a personal note , i think it\\'s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \\n', b\"the premise is simple , if not bizarre . \\na mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . \\nwhy ? \\nit's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun . \\nbased on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . \\nmike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . \\nthe catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live . \\ndr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . \\nthe purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . \\nwe watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . \\nin this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth . \\nwe basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . \\nthe plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one . \\nthis island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . \\ntogether the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . \\nto make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . \\nmst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . \\nas funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . \\noccasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . \\nalthough it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . \\nmst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . \\nalthough i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . \\nwarning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . \\nthe name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . \\nmost people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film . \\n\", b'according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \\neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \\non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \\nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \\nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \\ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \\nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini\\'s fascist regime . \\namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don\\'t like federico fellini\\'s work very much . \\nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \\ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \\nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \\nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn\\'t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini\\'s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \\nfellini\\'s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \\neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \\ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta\\'s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \\nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie\\'s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters\\' visions . \\nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \\neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini\\'s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \\nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \\nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn\\'t care that much about politics . \\nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini\\'s humanistic approach to his characters . \\neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \\nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \\nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \\nfellini couldn\\'t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \\nvignettes aren\\'t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character\\'s fantasies . \\nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \\neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \\non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \\nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini\\'s long-time associate nino rota . \\nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \\nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \\n', b'capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . \\nthe first few minutes of sweet sweetback\\'s baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that\\'s the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . \\na young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures . \\nthen one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that\\'s far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we\\'re not used to seeing on screen . \\nthis is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . \\n ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . ) \\nthe plot is simple but not simpleminded . \\nsweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell . \\nalong the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto . \\nin other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted . \\nssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( \" by an all-white jury \" , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it\\'s hardly surprising why . \\nthere\\'s a good deal of sex in the movie , but it\\'s handled in a way that\\'s unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie . \\nin one scene , sweetback visits a friend\\'s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet . \\nwe\\'re not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous . \\nthe movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles\\' hands . \\none scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack . \\nanother note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one\\'s own mind . \\nssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows . \\n', b\"summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money . \\nwild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies . \\nwill smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses . \\nhe is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing . \\nwest is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . ) \\nbefore i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives . \\nthere's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough . \\nthere's also a pleasant soundtrack . \\nburied deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes . \\nand salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see . \\napart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works . \\nfirstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money . \\none would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise . \\nboth of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end . \\nnot even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy . \\ntherefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious . \\nthe only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing . \\nshe appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith . \\nher character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character . \\nthe 'humour' in the film is also very off . \\nwill smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display . \\nthe script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk . \\nit's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself . \\nit's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably . \\nthe film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness . \\nthere's also problems with the plot . \\njim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill . \\nplot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly . \\nthe main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built . \\nwhy not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ? \\ndirector barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair . \\nwild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more . \\nit's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight . \\n\", b'tv\\'s buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in \" simply irresistible . \" \\nsarah michelle gellar , that never-ceasing crusader against never-ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network , here plays a down-on-her-luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals . \\ntaste test results : some vampire slaying , though out of place , would have really livened this excruciating movie up . \\n \" simply irresistible \" is actually quite easy to deny , a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on . \\ngellar\\'s amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom ( sean patrick flannery of powder ) around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking , a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public\\'s in her tiny tribeca eatery . \\nall this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story , a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993\\'s mexican classic \" like water for chocolate . \" \\nseveral differences : one , \" like water \" didn\\'t have a telekinetic crab , and two , \" like water \" was a good film . \\n \" simply irresistible , \" on the other hand , is about as challenging as an easy-bake oven . \\namateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness , from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger - though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish . \\nthe intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals , but it\\'s not like you\\'re were going to miss much . \\nin fact , take away the few instances of salty language and this has made-for-disney channel written all over it . \\nbut a majority of \" simply irresistible \" \\'s resistibility factor has less to do with the afore-mentioned overkill than the bland leads - tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there\\'s just no fun rooting for their inevitable \" happily ever after . \" \\nnor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense , so we\\'re left with a ho-hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs ; it\\'s not going to last long , people . \\nperhaps sensing this , the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley , dylan baker and patricia clarkson , but they don\\'t go anywhere either . \\nin fact , nothing in \" simply irresistible \" goes anywhere save for gellar , and she doesn\\'t go somewhere so much as you wish she\\'d go _somewhere_ - like to a better movie . \\nalready proving major talent with relatively few big- and small-screen roles , she\\'s the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn\\'t completely fit for the garbage disposal , looking smashing in her todd oldham-designed duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return . \\nit\\'s certainly a dish best not served in it\\'s current condition , but one can only guess that , without gellar , \" simply irresistible \" would be strictly unwatchable . \\n', b\"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . \\npeople who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . \\nthe story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . \\nthe action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . \\nshanta has a small circle of male admirers . \\ntwo of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . \\nthe others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . \\n ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) \\nin an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . \\none of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . \\nhe is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . \\nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \\nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \\nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \\nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \\na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \\nanother man is murdered . \\nthe group of friends will not meet again . \\nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \\nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \\nthe crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \\nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \\ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \\nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . \\nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . \\ndespite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \\nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . \\nthe story earth tells does not end . \\nit just stops . \\nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \\nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \\nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . \\nthere is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . \\nearth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . \\nit does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . \\nbut deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . \\nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . \\nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . \\nthey may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . \\nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . \\nthe issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . \\nin the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . \\nat the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding . \\n\", b'if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a late-night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80\\'s , they\\'d agree d . c . cab is the quintessential \" usa up all nite \" movie . \\nit\\'s one of those childish r-rated movies that kids would love but can\\'t see until it\\'s edited for tv . \\nit\\'s also one of those pointless , almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs . \\nand , strike three , it pairs mr . t with gary busey . \\ni heard gilbert say d . c . cab had \" an all-star cast , \" but i\\'m still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement . \\nwhen third-billing goes to a two-minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara \" as herself , \" you can\\'t say a damn thing about all-star casts . \\nlikewise for token appearances by marsha \" roz \" warfield , paul rodriguez and \" politically incorrect \" host bill maher , before he was somebody . \\nappearing in d . c . cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else , especially irene \" i\\'m gonna live forever \" cara . \\nd . c . cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher ( who would go on to direct batman forever ) about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs . \\nyou get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice , this would be the result , except here you have such interesting characters as the \" token white guy \" ( busey ) who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world , the token jive talker named tyrone ( charlie barnett ) who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word \" honkey \" as much as possible , the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains ( mr . t -- a real stretch for him ) , the aspiring musician waiting for his big break ( maher ) , the mexican gigolo ( rodriguez ) , the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living ( warfield ) and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living ( adam baldwin ) . \\nwe\\'ve all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80\\'s . \\nsome are fun to watch and some are actually funny . \\nthis one is more or less neither . \\nyou\\'d think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent ( whatever ) , but d . c . cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis , culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him . \\nit\\'s a shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality . \\nd . c . cab has rightly earned its position on \" usa up all nite . \" \\n', b'with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous \" ellen \" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . \\nthe birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . \\nthen along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . \\nit\\'s also noticeable that this \" alternative lifestyle \" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . \\nwhile it\\'s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . \\nbut the way we\\'re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . \\nwhile the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . \\nit doesn\\'t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it\\'s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . \\nthe idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . \\nif you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . \\nit\\'s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . \\nit\\'s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . \\nkevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . \\nafter a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . \\nthe small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . \\nwhen cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . \\neveryone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , \" and he\\'s gay . \" \\nthe town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . \\nthe thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . \\nnaturally the questions pour from howard\\'s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school\\'s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . \\nthe frenzy isn\\'t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and \" entertainment tonight \" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . \\none particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of \" inside entertainment \" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . \\nthe intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . \\nit seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . \\nthe dominoes begin to tumble as howard\\'s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . \\nit all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren\\'t presented with near-perfection by one of this year\\'s most delightful ensemble casts . \\nkline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . \\nthe great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . \\nevery single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . \\ndillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they\\'re up to bat . \\nrudnick\\'s script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you\\'ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . \\nwhile in & out doesn\\'t carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . \\nthe script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we\\'re allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . \\nit remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we\\'re still allowed a sappily touching ending . \\ndespite it\\'s subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . \\nfrank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick\\'s script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . \\ncheck this one out . \\nyou\\'ll have a gay old time . \\n', b'there isn\\'t much good about this movie . \\nnot much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie . \\nso i\\'ll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) didn\\'t direct it or it would be titled \" technicolor city \" . \\nin fact there is nothing colorful about this movie , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end . \\nthe plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie . \\nthe plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum . \\njohn murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything . \\njohn must find out who he is before the \" strangers \" ( a . k . a . \\nmind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy . \\nduring the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people . \\nany of these points however are completely \" erased \" from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script . \\nas i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film . \\nthe acting is bland , and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care . \\nthe special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake , a sign of a true \" b-movie \" . \\nthe direction is poor and there is little continuity , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly . \\nlastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality , and doesn\\'t deserve to have the word \" science \" in science-fiction . \\nif i haven\\'t got my point across , i\\'ll say it more plainly : this is a bad movie . \\nlets hope the next movie by alex \" i wish i was tim burton \" proyas is at least tolerable . \\n', b'the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film\\'s end . \\nif you\\'re not familiar with this law , then maybe you\\'ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film\\'s end . \\nnow if you\\'re a regular reader of mine , you\\'ve heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? \\nno , it definitely is not . \\nmelissa joan hart ( from abc\\'s \" sabrina , the teenage witch \" ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . \\nadrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who\\'s just broken up with his activist girlfriend . \\napparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . \\nso the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . \\nwill grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? \\nwill this crazy scheme work ? \\ndo i care ? \\nthe teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . \\nwhat makes movies like can\\'t hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she\\'s all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . \\ni don\\'t know what the writer\\'s intention was with drive me crazy . \\nthere was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . \\nhere there\\'s nothing . . . \\njust teens whining about who\\'s going to take them to the big dance . \\ndo me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . . \\njust shut the hell up . \\nin all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits . \\nnow normally when i say that it\\'s followed with the joke \" . . . because the movie is finally over . \" \\nin this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . \\nafter the obligatory second playing of britney spears\\' titular song , there\\'s a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . \\nnothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . \\nsci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries \" v \" and \" v : the final battle \" ) . \\n[pg-13] \\n', b'seen december 28 , 1997 at 8 : 45 p . m . at the crossgates mall cinema 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #8 , with matt perreault and my sister jena for free ( matt paid using pre-paid passes ) . \\nif there\\'s ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non- stop action , the james bond films are it . \\nand if there\\'s ever been a james bond film that not only proves this , but does so by pushing it to the extreme , \" tomorrow never dies \" is it . \\nopening sequences almost always make or break action films . \\nwhen done properly , not only are they actually exciting , but they foreshadow things to come . \\nthis film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie , but with a sense of the self-aware , enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in . \\nfirst there\\'s a high-tech , slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly , chinese waters . \\nthere\\'s definite tension as there seems to be an unknown , but certainly hostile , third party involved who is manipulating both sides . \\nwhen the scene ends in tragedy , it\\'s clear there\\'s some kind of powerful conspiracy going on , and who else to call on for such a case but james bond ? \\nthe film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond ( brosnon ) . \\nas the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious , bond is clearly ( and obviously ) depicted as an out-and-out hero . \\nhe single-handedly takes out a small army of terrorists , and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co-pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down ! \\nthis might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly . \\nit\\'s not about the payoff because it\\'s obvious bond will escape , instead , it\\'s the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy . \\nit seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping-out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term \" villain \" sounds passe ) . \\nwhat the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible . \\njonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons . \\nthrough some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news . \\nnot only is that an original idea for a conflict , but one which could carry over into reality . \\nsurprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become . \\nthe film\\'s hook is the action , and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way . \\nthe story works much like bond himself - always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot . \\nsomehow a chinese agent , wai lin ( yeoh ) , bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together . \\nthe chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid , but also works because of this , not in spite of it . \\nthe two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons , yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story . \\nalthough \" tomorrow never dies \" is far from perfect , it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue . \\n', b'alexander dumas\\' the three musketeers is one of the most often-adapted literary works , and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story . \\nperhaps the musketeer , a new film that \" reimagines \" the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix , is one adaptation too many . \\nit\\'s just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent , repetitive action sequences . \\nthis time , d\\'artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers , who can\\'t even pronounce his character\\'s name . \\nas a boy , he watched his father get killed by febre ( tim roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry cardinal richelieu . \\nhe vowed to have vengeance . \\nafter undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy . \\non his quest , he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government . \\nthe royal musketeers have lost their gusto , what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal\\'s own guards . \\nonly a few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them athos and portos ( who are only figureheads in this movie ) . \\ntogether with d\\'artagnan , they fight to extricate the queen ( catherine deneuve ) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant . \\noh , and as an afterthought , d\\'artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( mena suvari ) . \\njust thought i\\'d mention that . \\nnow , look : i don\\'t know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue-lashing . \\ni have nothing against \" modernizing \" classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side effects . \\ndirector peter hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days , has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas\\' masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie . \\ninstead , we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing . \\nwhen the musketeers finally get to holler \" all for one , and one for all , \" i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt . \\nmaybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams\\'s tone , which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader\\'s digest condensed version of the story that he gives us . \\nit\\'s as though anything that may have been construed as \" fun \" was purposely expunged from the production . \\nthe joylessness of the proceedings , from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes , can be felt in every frame . \\nchambers can\\'t act ; suvari , roth and deneuve can , but aren\\'t given the chance . \\nand when push comes to shove , the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious , though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit . \\nsome movies seem sloppy and careless , clearly made for a quick buck . \\nwith the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful . \\nthe film is intricate , stylish and precise , hitting the wrong note every single time . \\n', b'synopsis : lifelong friends rafe ( affleck ) and danny ( hartnett ) join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor , hawaii . \\nrafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action . \\ndanny falls in love with rafe\\'s girlfriend , evelyn ( beckinsale ) , but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend . \\nmeanwhile , the japanese sneak attack is imminent . . . \\nreview : \" pearl harbor \" is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art . \\nit is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo the masses , enticing them with big stars , big effects , and a big setting -- but no heart . \\nit is difficult to criticise the actors , because they do everything the movie demands of them . \\nsadly , this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing \" pearl harbor \" with his left . \\nthe plot here is pure cliche , and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop . \\nthere is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states , and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii . \\ninstead , there is just an assembly-line love triangle , some empty patriotic rhetoric , and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders ( when one intones , \" i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant \" , i nearly fell out of my seat ) . \\nto the movie\\'s credit , it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself , an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war . \\nif only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill , perhaps this memorial day non-event would have been worth watching . \\n', b'movies like six days , seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford , anne heche , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents . ? \\nthe script was written by michael browning , and he decided that , instead of thinking up new ideas , he\\'d rehash a lot of cliches , omit even the slightest bit of character development , and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions . ? \\nthere are good scripts out there that high-profile actors can make ( see the truman show , for instance ) . ? \\nsix days , seven nights is simply a waste . \\nlet\\'s see . \\n . \\n . \\nwe have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island . ? \\nso , how do we do that ? ? \\nwell , we\\'ll make her a feisty magazine editor , and we\\'ll make him a crusty old pilot . ? \\nbut wait , she has to have a fianc ? e ; that can be david schwimmer

\\nyessssss ! ? \\nso , they\\'ll crash on the island , and that will be funny for about five minutes . ? \\nshucks . \\noh , i\\'ve got it ! ? \\nwe\\'ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc ? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo , and then he can feel guilty . ? \\nthen , when anne heche kisses harrison ford ( they have to kiss , because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie ) , it will be a vindicated action , because her fianc ? e will already have cheated on her ! ? \\nthen , for no obvious reason , they\\'ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them . ? \\noh , yes ! ? \\ni feel so good about this story . ? \\ninstead of using characterization to propel the events , it will be completely random , and yet totally predictable ! ? \\nimagine that . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong -- six days , seven nights is not a boring picture ; ford and heche both do a great job . ? \\nthe sparks fly between them , and so most of browning\\'s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors\\' sheer force of talent . \\n ? almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen , and i found myself laughing pretty hard . ? \\nschwimmer is also funny , and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get . ? \\nand reitman , who has made some good films , at least tries to make things exciting . ? \\neven though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb , i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences . \\nit\\'s just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces . ? \\nthe picture feels like it\\'s been hacked to pieces -- i wouldn\\'t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely . ? \\nthe ones that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships ) , and i\\'d just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream , \" why did you pick this awful script ! ? \" ? \\nthe film is outright stupid , but some of the elements are subtly horrifying . ? \\nfor instance , take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo , and then feels really guilty . ? \\nthis is a serious problem in real life , but six days , seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device : ? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford . ? \\nin a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety , i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story . \\nthis is summer movie season , but that doesn\\'t mean our movies have to be dumb . ? \\n1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters . ? \\nwhen i was in line for six days , seven nights , i heard the woman in front of me ask for \" two tickets to that new harrison ford movie . \" \\n ? why didn\\'t she know the name of the film ? ? \\ni suppose she just didn\\'t care . \\n ? what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big-budget pictures don\\'t realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves . ? \\ngood actors should sign to good scripts , and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash , they least they could do is assume that we\\'d like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents . \\n', b'the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany\\'s in which the audience is rooting for some sweet , vulnerable , irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness . \\nthe problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo ( played by sook-yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible . \\nalessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene . \\nthis is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland . \\none of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa . \\nshe also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window . \\nnext door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) . \\nhe sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating . \\nben gets emotionally involved with alessa . \\n ( as alessa so delicately puts it , \" we were bosom buddies , now we\\'re fuck buddies . \" ) \\nbut alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor . \\nthe real problem with the film seems to be helen lee\\'s inability to decide what she wants to be saying . \\nshe undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa . \\nalessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients . \\nthis appears to be a high profile and well-paid job . \\nwe are supposed to care about alessa\\'s feelings , but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father . \\nalessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint . \\nthis is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double-zero . \\ni rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n', b'in \" magic town \" , jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a \" perfect \" town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll-takers care about . \\nhowever , as time progresses , and he finds himself falling in love with the town ( and a woman ) , he begins to see that what he\\'s doing is wrong . \\nthe plot is standard stuff , but that\\'s not important . \\nin a film like this , it\\'s the calibre of the actors that make or break it . \\nobviously , since stewart stars , that\\'s practically a non-issue . \\nhe\\'s great in the film , as usual . \\nthere\\'s just something about him that always manages to be endearing , even when he\\'s deceiving the town folk . \\nyou\\'re always on his side , and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition . \\nthe film was directed by a longtime frank capra script-writer , and it shows . \\nthis is the type of feel-good picture that capra is famous for . \\nby the time \" the end \" shows up on screen , everything has been wrapped up very nicely . \\nthere are no loose ends , and virtually every character gets a happy ending ( those that deserve one , anyway ) . \\nin this age of cynicism , it\\'s refreshing to see a movie so upbeat . \\n \" magic town \" is a delightfully entertaining motion picture . \\nif you believe all old movies are slow-paced , you\\'d be well-advised to check this one out . \\n', b'after indecent proposal and up close and personal , redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last . \\nredford may look great on-screen , but over the past few years , he\\'s proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera . \\nordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties , and it was the first picture he helmed . \\nwhile the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with . . . um , \\nrealism , and i\\'ve never been much of a fan of a river runs through it ( to the chagrin of many ) , quiz show was dazzling , energetic and convincing . \\nthe horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub-genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery . \\nscott-thomas plays annie maclean , an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace ( johanssen ) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi . \\ngrace\\'s horse survived , but barely , and has gone mad . \\nannie refuses to put the animal out of his misery , believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace\\'s newly-broken spirit . \\neventually , mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker ( redford ) , a famed \" horse whisperer \" who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches , leaving busy husband neill behind . \\neventually , they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom\\'s family , and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana , including , naturally , tom , the wise and lonely trainer . \\nthe horse whisperer is delicately made . \\ni dare say lyrical , since to many people\\'s ear , that word is synonymous with boring . \\nhardly . \\nthe horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise , but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch , especially in the final third of the story . \\nscott-thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter , and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell , especially since d . p . \\nrobert richardson\\'s photography casts montana as heaven on earth . \\n ( a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana . ) \\nthe underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt , emotive performance as the nice-guy husband , who is as authoritive and likeable as tom . \\nhe is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist , lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating spouse\\'s motivation . \\nunfortunately , one of the horse whisperer\\'s only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers scott-thomas and redford . \\ni liked both of them , but i didn\\'t necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish , even if the countryside air thawed her slightly . \\nluckily ( and curiously ) , this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn\\'t quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought , the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters\\' complex relationships together . \\n', b\"the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . \\nthis slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . \\nwhen the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . \\nupon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . \\nas the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . \\ndid dolores kill her husband ? \\nand did she kill her employer ? \\ndolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . \\nconsequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . \\nkathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . \\ndolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . \\nshe dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . \\nkathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . \\nthe rest of the cast is also very good . \\njennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . \\ndavid strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . \\njudy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . \\nchild actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . \\nthe direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . \\nthe segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . \\nthe pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . \\nhowever , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . \\nit would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . \\nnone of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . \\nalthough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . \\ndolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . \\nhowever , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . \\non my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . \\n\", b\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nat the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . \\nthis highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \\nand with good reason . \\nthis is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \\nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \\n ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \\numa thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \\nunfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \\nat this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \\nthe duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \\nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \\nif nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \\nthe story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \\n ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \\noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \\nthe avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \\nmr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \\nat least it all looks good . \\nthis is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . \\nin particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . \\nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . \\nby the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \\nnot coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . \\nit's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . \\na crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . \\nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \\n\", b'plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he\\'s devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . \\ncritique : i\\'m a sucker for movies like this . \\na young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time . \\nin the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer . \\nhis entry and adaptation to the whole \" rock \\'n roll \" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . \\nalthough i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . \\nmetal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn\\'t that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . \\nthat\\'s not to say that you won\\'t like this film if you don\\'t like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all . \\nbut the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . \\nwow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film\\'s original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) . \\nhe is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . \\nhe came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . \\naniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn\\'t pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . \\ni was also impressed by some of the \" real \" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . \\nit\\'s to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) . \\njust for the record , i\\'m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it\\'s a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . \\noh yeah , and for those who dig the \" heavier \" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! \\nyou see . . . dreams \\ncan come true . . . \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nalmost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) \\n', b'everyone\\'s heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene . \\neveryone\\'s heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over . \\nand everyone\\'s got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance . \\ngood ! \\nthat\\'s what you\\'re supposed to do ! \\noh , if you are one of the ones who hasn\\'t seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven\\'t heard about what happens , here\\'s your spoiler warning . \\ndeliverance was a real shocker for it\\'s time ( 1972 ) . \\nmajor advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry . \\nwhen it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences . \\nit was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) . \\nbut by today\\'s film standards and in today\\'s world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn\\'t as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e . g . \\npulp fiction ) . \\npulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny . \\nbut in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter . \\nthe story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory . \\nthe initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others . \\njoining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox ) . \\nthe group\\'s first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip . \\nthey make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40 . 00 for the task . \\ndrew also has the famous \" dueling banjos \" competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged . \\nthe men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way . \\neverything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone . \\nthey encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them . \\ned is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men . \\ned nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist\\'s back . \\nthe other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body . \\ndisposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film . \\nwhile attempting to make a quick \" paddle for it \" , both canoes tip over . \\ndrew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found . \\nlewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition . \\nthis leaves ed and bobby . \\ned decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly , alone , with the bow and arrow . \\nthe question arises if he will be able to handle himself , as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer , to which his comment \" i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing \" will have more meaning in the future . \\ndeliverance is definitely a wild ride ( oops , i\\'m doing it again ) . \\nit is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic . \\nit\\'s definitely one of those \" must see \" movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade . \\n', b'i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars . \\nfrom my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet\\'s film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . \\nfrom my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet\\'s script was actually a masterpiece . \\nthe spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer\\'s complete attention . \\nmiss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film . \\nalso like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending . \\nmamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games . \\nlike his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim . \\nbecause we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film . \\nmamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end . \\nthe power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious . \\nthe spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued . \\nafter seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening . \\nhis direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . \\nthe story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative \" process \" that everyone is trying to get their hands on . \\nsoon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his \" process . \" \\nthrough his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross\\' boss mr . klein . \\nplayed by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role . \\nthe most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott\\'s joe ross . \\nthe character\\'s transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable . \\ndavid mamet\\'s script is so interesting because we know people don\\'t actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them . \\nhis beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge . \\nthis is a must see , for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie . \\n', b'when i first saw the previews for ron howard\\'s latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low . \\na show about nothing ? \\nsounds like \" seinfeld . \" \\na guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ? \\nsounds like \" the truman show . \" \\nwhat is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ? \\nwhich is why i was pleasantly surprised by \" edtv , \" which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity . \\nthe writing , by howard\\'s longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus . \\nin the hands of a less-experienced director , \" edtv \" could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday\\'s meatloaf . \\nwith their \\'true tv\\' cable ratings being threatened by \\'the gardening channel\\' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers . \\nprogram director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment . \\nthe hook is to find a regular guy , someone normal that people can relate to . \\nwhile scouting possible candidates , cynthia\\'s camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray ( woody harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame . \\nbut on watching the videotape , the show\\'s producers are more taken with ed than with ray . \\nhe\\'s cute , he says all the wrong things , and he\\'s 100% usda hick . \\ncynthia\\'s boss , played by rob reiner , gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it\\'s tough going in the early stages . \\nthe most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth . \\n \" action shot ! \" \\nwags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster . \\nyou get the idea . \\nbut soon enough , things--nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the \\'true tv\\' cameras are right there to document it . \\ned\\'s privacy is no longer his own , his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life , and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media . \\nwho should ed go out with ? \\nyou can be sure the pollsters have a list . \\nnot only is the film exceedingly well cast , but its performers are consistently excellent . \\nmatthew mcconaughey provides the face , the body language , and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america\\'s latest phenomenon . \\nhe and harrelson look like they really could be brothers . \\nsally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed\\'s mother , and martin landau is one of the film\\'s highlights as al , ed\\'s ailing stepfather . \\njenna elfman ( from tv\\'s \" dharma and greg \" ) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau , although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting . \\neven degeneres and reiner are better than you\\'d expect . \\nin 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called \" real life \" in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time documentary about a typical american family . \\nthe scenes of ed\\'s family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor . \\nas with most films by albert brooks , \" real life \" was funny , but absurd . \\nthe funniest--and scariest--thing about \" edtv \" is that it is absolutely believable . \\n', b'john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles . \\nso effortlessly that people tend to forget he\\'s there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor\\'s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) . \\nexample : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn\\'t be more divergent--- i\\'ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! \\nwas a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn\\'t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation . \\ni muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity . \\nshe responded with her usual query , \" whose in that one ? \" \\nthis is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . \\nif the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . \\nanyway , when i answered \" john cusack \" , she replied with a rather stunned \" who ? \" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . \\nnow i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it\\'s understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . \\ni showed her a picture of cusack\\'s mug in the paper hoping for an \" oh - him , yes he\\'s quite good \" instead i got a \" no - i don\\'t know him \" . \\nat this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack\\'s relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . \\ncu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool . \\ni\\'m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as \" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) \" . \\nhe\\'s not a brand name , and his movies usually aren\\'t big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he\\'s kind of a genius . \\nwith his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90\\'s . \\nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . \\ndespite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he\\'s a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . \\nand he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin\\'s and val kilmer\\'s seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . \\nhigh fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it\\'s a hit . \\nit was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . \\nit\\'s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . \\nhigh fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his \" top 5 break ups list \" . \\nthis is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller\\'s day off . \\nat first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack\\'s witty delivery . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy we don\\'t mind talking directly to us . \\ngradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it\\'s all very existential ) . \\nthough that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . \\nthe best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis\\' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy i\\'m sure we\\'ve all met before , a blowhard who thinks he\\'s always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others . \\nbut i like this guy , because of how black plays him . \\nthe actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) . \\nhe\\'s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films . \\n ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) . \\nbut fears and black never let that happen . \\nthe character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality . \\nhe\\'s over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to . \\ncatherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own \" charm \" . \\ntim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect . \\nthe one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation . \\ni give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it\\'s hard to see why cusack\\'s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings . \\nthis reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those \" special people \" whose wheels turn a little slower ) . \\nin fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i\\'d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective . \\nhigh fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances . \\nfears\\' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i\\'m beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i\\'ll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) . \\nbut cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian . \\ni\\'m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . \\nhis character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement . \\n', b'tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance , and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered marketing materials for crap movies . \\nand here he hits rock bottom , with planet of the apes . \\ni didn\\'t expect much from this latest \" interpretation \" of pierre boulle\\'s classic novel planet of the apes . \\ni mean , how could you top the force and impact of the original film , intelligently co-scripted by rod serling ( of twilight zone fame ) combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those \" damn dirty apes , \" in one of his best roles of his career ? \\nsadly , i sat down to watch burton\\'s version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes , i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off . \\nthis time around , the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine , braveheart , and project x . marky mark wahlberg , who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter , plays leo davidson , a hot shot u . s . air force pilot . \\nleo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms ( no real explanation given in the film ) and leo sends one of his genetically altered \" smart \" chimps into the storms to collect data . \\nleo and his crew lose communication with the chimp , leo hops in another ship to find the monkey , and then he\\'s thrown through some type of time-space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot , all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle . \\nleo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter ) . \\nthe kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo\\'s ship . \\nalong the way , monkeys played by tim roth ( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade ) and michael clarke duncan ( who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie ) strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages , just like battlefield earth ! \\nin the end , it all culminates into another braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene . \\nwhile rick baker\\'s makeup work is amazing , the script is a pathetic hodgepodge ( courtesy of three writers ) , the acting is horrible , and the \" surprise \" ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple . \\nwahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences . \\nthis remake , or re-interpretation , as tim burton has proclaimed it , is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film . \\nthe ethical arguments about the equality of species , fascism , and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue , an unimaginative narrative structure , and a romance between a monkey and a human . \\neven chuck heston\\'s anti-gun tirade ( in the de rigeur cameo ) seems shallow and jokey . \\nbut the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton . \\neven though his name is plastered across every billboard in america , john badham could have directed this film . \\neven joel schumacher could have directed this film . \\nhe probably should have . \\nburton\\'s predominant themes of rejection , isolation , and the search for one\\'s place in the universe , as seen in ed wood , edward scissorshands , and pee-wee\\'s big adventure , are completely absent in this planet . \\ni suppose that\\'s what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole . \\n', b'ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead . \\nbruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) . \\nthe results shown on screen are amazing considering the film\\'s tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years . \\nfollowed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) . \\nthe dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it\\'s original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . \\nthe disc contains two versions of the film\\'s audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 . \\nincluded are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film\\'s star , bruce campbell . \\ncampbell\\'s commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film . \\nsuch informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it\\'s title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard . \\nalso , there\\'s a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they\\'ve found that\\'s explaining about the demonic forces in the woods . \\nfor that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene . \\nalmost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor\\'s had never smoked before , and as a result they became \" confused \" and were unable to perform the scene . \\ni wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track . \\nthe two people you\\'d think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong here , when they do speak it\\'s entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time . \\nsometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask \" have anything to say sam ? \" \\nto me , that\\'s not a good sign . \\nalso , it seems like sam raimi doesn\\'t remember much about the film and it\\'s production . . . \\nwell , compared to rob and bruce anyway . \\nalso included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film\\'s \" gala \" premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film . \\nthis raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques . \\noverall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it\\'s genre . \\nand the collector\\'s edition dvd release is well worth your time if you\\'re either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process . \\nall special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining . \\n', b'one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb\\'s runaway hit dawson\\'s creek . \\nfollowing in the foot steps of mtv\\'s two other live action films , joe\\'s apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace . \\nset in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john \" mox \" moxon ( van der beek ) . \\nwe know he\\'s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook . \\ncoach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him . \\nthe star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) . \\nalso on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin . \\nwhen lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies . \\nhis relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there\\'s a big game at the end . \\nguess who wins ? \\nnothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love . \\nthere\\'s a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow . \\nvan der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes . \\nalso , the role isn\\'t very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character . \\nhe\\'s still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock . \\nvoight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out . \\nthe other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don\\'t fare much better . \\non the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) . \\nscott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team\\'s wild man . \\nlarter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film\\'s most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening \" whipped cream bikini . \" \\nit\\'s interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) . \\nall this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson\\'s creek , presumably the target audience for the picture . \\ndirector brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression . \\nthe look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it . \\nthe football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out . \\nthere\\'s an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it\\'s not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film . \\n', b'capsule : side-splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end . . . \\nbut not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs . \\nmost comedies these days have one flaw . \\nthey\\'re not funny . \\nthey think they\\'re funny , but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly . \\noccasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem : ruthless people , for instance , which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end . \\nliar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny . \\nthis is one of the few movies i\\'ve seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set-pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct ) , the whole movie works like clockwork . \\njim carrey playes a high-powered lawyer , to whom lying is as natural as breathing . \\nthere is one thing he takes seriously , though : his son , and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away . \\nbut his wife is divorced and seeing another man , and now it looks like they may move away together . \\nthe son goes with them , of course . \\nthe movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey\\'s over-the-top persona with reality . \\nthen the plot springs into action : after being snubbed ( not deliberately ) by his father at his birthday , the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles : that for just one day , dad can\\'t lie . \\nhe gets the wish . \\nwhat happens next is sidesplitting . \\neverything turns into a confrontation : when cornered by a bum for some change , he shouts , \" no ! \\ni\\'m not giving you any money because i know you\\'ll spend it on booze ! \\nall i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society ! \" \\nhe can\\'t even get into an elevator without earning a black eye . \\nand what\\'s worse , he\\'s now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture . \\ncarrey , who i used to find unfunny , has gotten better at his schtick , even if it\\'s a limited one . \\nhe uses it to great effect in this movie . \\nthere is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process ( there\\'s a grin breaking out across my face right now , just remembering the scene ) . \\nhe can\\'t even write the lie ; his fingers twitch , his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning , and when he tries to talk it\\'s like he\\'s speaking in tongues . \\nequally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp ( don\\'t ask why ) , tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom ( it fails , with semi-predictable results ) , and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them . \\nthis scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end . \\nthe movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end . \\na shame , too , because the movie insists on having a big , ridiculous climax that involves carrey\\'s character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs , then breaking his leg , etc . a simple reconciliation would do the trick . \\nwhy is this stupid pent-up climax always obligatory ? \\nit\\'s not even part of the movie\\'s real agenda . \\nthankfully , liar liar survives it , and so does carrey . \\nmaybe they were being merciful , on reflection . \\nif i\\'d laughed any more , i might have needed an iron lung . \\n', b'the seasoned capt . dudley smith ( james cromwell ) questions his new protege , ed exley ( guy pearce ) about his political views when it comes to police work . \\n \" would you plant evidence to get a conviction if you knew the person to be guilty ? \\nwould you shoot a man in the back if you knew that it was the only way to make sure he got what he deserved ? \" \\nexley , squeaky clean , innocent , and pent with the desire to perform his new duties with integrity and honesty quickly answers with a pointed \\'no . \\' \\nstunned , smith pleads , \" then , for the love of god , don\\'t be a detective . \" \\nla confidential is a dandy piece of filmmaking that brings us back to the classic times of hollywood in the 50s . \\norganized crime was the biggest concern , corruption existed everywhere , and every cop had his own way of getting the job done . \\nthere was \" hollywood \" jack vincennes ( kevin spacey ) who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tell-all/show-all tabloid , sid hudgeons ( danny devito ) . \\nsporting dark sunglasses and a white sports coat , he isn\\'t afraid to flash his tinseltown style . \\ndetective bud white ( russell crowe ) has only a narrow-minded view of the law , and he uses excessive force to exact his unique kind of interrogation and brutal justice . \\nand then there is golden boy exley , wide-eyed and ambitious but extremely naive . \\na horrible multiple murder begins to draw these three men together , each of whom become inexorably connected in their search for truth , action , and personal vindication . \\nalmost immediately , an arrest is made . \\nbut something doesn\\'t seem quite right . \\nnew developments become sinuous as the story begins to draw us deeper into the labyrinth of corruption and crime within the department . \\nsuspicion and questions begin to mount . \\nodd alliances are created . \\nand as layers of the truth become revealed , the story grows more complex and intriguing by the moment . \\nwhen the mystery expands , we see other seemingly guilty characters enter the lives of these three cops , including a high-priced hooker ( kim basinger ) and a shady millionaire ( david strathairn ) . \\nall of the characters\\' levels of involvement are not immediately clear . \\nwe watch with riveted fascination to learn more about why they are there and their stake in the case . \\nwe sense a cross-pollination of clues that brings us , the audience , closer to the truth . \\nwe hope that the three detectives can throw away their spite for one another and can pull their resources together in order to untangle the intricately created web of mystery . \\nabsorbing and affecting , this movie has all the necessary ingredients to create a terrific gourmet serving of film noir . \\nit boasts mysterious figures in control , double-crosses , hard information from sleazy sources , dirty politicians , corrupt cops , haunting women , and hard-nosed cops experiencing moral ambiguity . \\nthe underlying mystery is compelling . \\nthe look and feel of the movie is gorgeous . \\nthe entire cast is crisp and wonderful to watch ( i wouldn\\'t be surprised if cromwell received an oscar nomination for his performance ) . \\nand , the dialogue is rich and memorable . \\nthe best line of the movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of what to do . \\n \" don\\'t start trying to do the right thing , boy-o , \" says he . \\n \" you haven\\'t had the practice . \" \\n \" l . a . confidential\\'\\' triumphantly achieves the rare gift of complexity and coherence while satisfying our desire for a good old-fashioned movie . \\n', b\"as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients . \\nhe is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony . \\nand , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer . \\nin the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal . \\nhis unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) . \\nhe is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division . \\nlomax is soon given the case of his life . \\nhe must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide . \\nthe draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell . \\nhe works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) . \\nbut what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story . \\nit begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed . \\nbut milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm . \\nquite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago . \\nfreaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed . \\nthe movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts . \\nthe first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer . \\nthe second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax . \\nunfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere . \\ngranted , the film is very handsome-looking . \\nyou'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino . \\nyou'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties . \\nyou'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away . \\nthis was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub-plot . \\nas with all thing's involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst . \\nin the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background . \\nhis path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored . \\nhis actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not fully known . \\npacino's comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie . \\nthere is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited . \\nthe focus seemed inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap . \\nthis movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time . \\nhowever , while the devil's advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it makes very little impression at all . \\n\", b'contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan\\'s only novel . \\nit details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) . \\nwe first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project . \\nher research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains \" pure research \" in favor of science with \" commercial applications . \\nshe goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r . \\nhadden ( john hurt ) . \\nthen , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal . \\nin the movie\\'s most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega . \\nat first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before . \\nfurther decoding , with hadden\\'s help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine . \\nit appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens\\' home world . \\nof course , the big question becomes \" who gets to ride it ? \" \\n ( right after \" who\\'s gonna pay for this thing ? \" ) . \\nto boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith . \\ndrumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep \" godless science \" from talking to god , or something like that ) . \\nthen hadden reappears with startling news . \\nhe has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest . \\nellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) . \\nwhen she returns home , no one believes her . \\nshe was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours . \\nher story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don\\'t even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static . \\n . \\n . \\neighteen hours worth of static ) . \\nthere is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first . \\nellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working . \\nneither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that\\'s a tough standard to meet . \\nellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures . \\nher real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally . \\ndrumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble . \\nhadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board . \\neven palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie\\'s love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses . \\nthe film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine . \\nthe part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain . \\nthe film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion . \\nthis is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved . \\nthe film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith . \\nreligious people are presented as shallow caricatures . \\nrob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right . \\nanother religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) . \\nthe only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague . \\ni can\\'t even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian . \\nall we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex . \\nthe film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith . \\nin a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist \" religious \" doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send . \\nin a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism . \\nwhat ellie should have said was , \" you shouldn\\'t believe me . \\nnot without evidence , and i don\\'t have the evidence . \\ni know what happened but you shouldn\\'t take my word alone . \" \\nthat is the voice of science speaking . \\nthe character of david drumlin is another problem with this film . \\nhis attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position . \\nalso , his profession of \" faith \" before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it . \\nthe last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles . \\nthe media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren\\'t so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary . \\nthe use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause . \\nfirst of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy . \\nalso , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it . \\npeople watching this film in the future will say , \" hey , this never took place during clinton\\'s term . \" \\nthis bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief . \\nalso , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century . \\nbetter to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all . \\nthe film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way . \\nif we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ? \\npersonally , i would hope not , since religion is basically an opinion , a form of ideology . \\ni would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task . \\n', b'plot : a down-and-out girl moves in with some over-the-top models and falls in love with a goofy-but-loveable guy from across the street . \\naaaaaaaaah ! \\nthen one day , she sees him knock a woman upside the head with a baseball bat . \\nooooooooh ! \\nshe must then join together with her model-friends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofy-but-loveable , or a psycho killer . \\naaaaaaaaah ! \\ncritique : completely idiotic . \\nokay , so maybe i\\'m being a little too nice . \\nthis movie starts off dumb , moves into the ridiculous and eventually graduates to idiocy . \\nthere . . . that\\'s \\nmore like it ! \\nand how , you may ask ? \\nwell , it\\'s simple really . \\nfour of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world ( oh my god , i just found out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real life . . . yipes ! ) \\njoin monica potter ( in a role which can only be described as an obvious cry for help ) and freddie prinze jr . ( not the actor , but the character better known as freddie prinze jr . ) , in a plot so stupid and far-fetched , that you have to wonder once more , how crap like this gets by the hollywood bigwigs . \\nthis thing stinks to high-heaven . \\nit\\'s just plain embarrassing for everyone involved . \\ni even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into this so-called romantic-comedy-action movie ? \\nugh . \\nwhat a pile of dung . \\nhey , i\\'m actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here , but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from time to time . \\nit\\'s sad really . \\na movie which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy , including the over-used \" folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else comes in to take a crap and fart \" gag . \\nand how about that dumb blonde model who keeps running into things . \\npure hilarity ! \\nor maybe i\\'m just too jaded , too much of a critic , not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluff-piece . . . uuuhhmmm . . . naaaaah ! ! \\nthis movie sucks the big one . \\nit\\'s chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot . \\nthis is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only because . . . well , \\nit\\'s supposed to be funny , see ? \\nyou see , that person then has their legs swinging in the other person\\'s face as they drive and that distracts the driver , see , and well , that\\'s kinda funny , no ? \\nharumph . . . yeah , \\nwell . . . you \\nget the picture ! \\nanyhoo , freddie prinze jr . . . . nuff \\nsaid . \\nmonica potter , a bad career move , but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit . \\nthe rest of the model girls . . . well , \\nthanks for being there so i had something to look at , but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole , for making them all out to be complete imbeciles ! ! \\nso why the three points out of ten , you may ask ? \\nwell , it\\'s simple really . \\none point goes to the russian model girl and that cool accent ( don\\'t ask me why , but it actually turned me on ) . \\none point goes out to all of the model girls for being in the movie ( nice window decoration . . . natch ! ) . \\nand one last point goes out to the makers of this film , who spared us any long sorted story , and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage , so that we could run out as fast as we can , grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them of the devil that is . . . freddie prinze jr . . . i \\nmean , head over heels . \\nyou\\'ve been warned , good people . \\nps : didja notice how i didn\\'t even mention rear window once in my entire review ? \\ni didn\\'t want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing , but then again , i just did mention it , but i guess it doesn\\'t count in the ps section . . . or \\ndoes it ? \\nooooh , whatever . . . i have a headache ! \\n ( i think my brain is coming back to life ) \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\n10 things i hate about you ( 7/10 ) - coyote ugly ( 6 . 5/10 ) \\n- down to you ( 6 . 5/10 ) \\n- save the last dance ( 7/10 ) - she\\'s all that ( 6 . 5/10 ) \\n- the wedding planner ( 4/10 ) - you\\'ve got mail ( 5 . 5/10 ) \\n', b\"the haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us . \\nif you've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie . \\nthey have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film . \\nbut , the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film . \\nfor instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers . \\nthey had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? \\nwell , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well . \\nunfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i'd be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers . \\nthat title would be the confusing . \\nok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly . \\nit basically serves up no purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb . \\nliam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth . \\nthe haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money . \\nbefore i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film . \\nfirst , the house is great- looking . \\nit looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot . \\nit looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it . \\nthis is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film . \\nthings look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight . \\nhaunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie . \\nthe hill house is not eerie . \\nit is beautiful , but not the least bit frightening . \\never heard of lili taylor ? \\nbefore this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now . \\nshe gives the only satisfactory performance in the film . \\ndespite the dry dialogue and boring/confusing concept , she manages to light up the screen every time she appears , but unfortunately , her co-stars are usually following right behind . \\nowen wilson , who plays luke , is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance , other then taylor . \\nhe is basically there for the comic relief , and his character development is poor in all other areas . \\nall of the characters are desperately underdeveloped . \\nwilson had potential as luke , but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs . \\nliam neeson and catherine zeta-jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film . \\ntheir characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot . \\nthey just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting's coffin . \\nthe plot is terrible . \\nthe opening scene of the film is very important , but the director makes it too obvious by getting close-ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film . \\nas i sat through the film , i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish . \\nnell , lili taylor's character , goes from the hunted to the savior . \\nit makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film . \\nhe forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in-depth information . \\nfor instance , the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program . \\nbut , we get zilch for the other four . \\nplus , two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes . \\nand the worst part : most horror films have killings . \\nfor some reason , they kill off luke at the end of the film . \\nno reason whatsoever , just off with his head , literally . \\noverall , the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie . \\nbad plot , confusing storyline and a waste of good talent . \\nhopefully , liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential . \\nhopefully , lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film . \\nand hopefully , other horror films , such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house , will not be as bad as this one . \\n\", b'can you say \" dated \" ? \\nyou can if you\\'ve seen rosemary\\'s baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release . \\n \" mystery science theater 3000 \" has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the \" good \" ones too . \\nrosemary\\'s baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success . \\nit all seems so harmless in the beginning . \\nmia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed . \\n ( there\\'s also a skull in the living room , but it\\'s only for decoration . ) \\ntheir elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming . \\nall\\'s well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors\\' chocolate mousse and passes out . \\nwhen she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen . \\nit seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it . \\nand everyone\\'s helping with the pregnancy . \\nthe neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who\\'s been in the business 66 . 6 \\nyears . \\nmeanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight . \\nbefore too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries . \\nthat\\'s when you know your health\\'s failing . \\nthe only person in the movie who\\'s the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma . \\nby about the two-hour mark i felt the same way . \\nrosemary\\'s baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that\\'s about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie . \\ni guess someone put a spell on this movie . \\n', b\"near the end of frank capra's holiday classic , its a wonderful life , george bailey ( jimmy stewart ) is feeling down . \\nhe has devoted his life to others , and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town , bedford falls . \\nstanding upon a bridge above stormy waters , he looks down , contemplating suicide . \\nhe has potential he hasn't fulfilled -- yet , he has done so much for others . \\nas a young chap , his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls . \\nbut times and ambitions change . \\nthings happen , and he's stuck . \\nhis guardian angel is there , and shows him that . . . it's \\na wonderful life . \\nin a whirlwind tour of the town , george sees what life would be like without him . \\nhe learns the moral lesson , that to live is a gift . \\nhis earthly problems are solved . \\nthe climatic scene is a marvel . \\nfrank capra's film is a centenial classic -- watched and re-experienced by every generation . \\nwonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh , maybe fresher , then it did when it was first released . \\nmany films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly . \\nbut this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with first-rate acting , wit and suspense , glorious music , and terrific set peices . \\nthe only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence , george's guardian angel . \\nthey aren't all that bad , but they remain corny and a little out of place . \\nnevertheless , this is one film that deserves its place in time , cinema history , and our hearts . \\nit can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age . \\nhere is one genuine masterpeice , a classic that reaches heights and ambitions near perfection . \\nthis crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny , exciting , moving and uplifting . \\nthe film itself is almost a reversal of the life of george bailey -- there isn't too much to it , but capra and the gang ( various screenwriters , composers , actors ) plumet the material to its fullest potential . \\nthe result is a film -- though not at first intended to be pigeon-holed as a holiday film -- that will always be remembered , celebrated , and loved . \\n\", b'in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she\\'ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they\\'ll most enjoy . \\nsome scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . \\nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat\\'s true colors begin to shine through . \\nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom\\'s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \\nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom\\'s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what\\'s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \\nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \\nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \\nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \\nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne\\'s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . \\non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne\\'s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \\nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \\njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character\\'s determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat\\'s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . \\nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . \\njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . \\ncarrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . \\nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . \\na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . \" \\nthat\\'s not to say the men don\\'t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o\\'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . \\nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . \\ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman\\'s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . \\nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . \\nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom\\'s chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . \\nand it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . \\nthe bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure . \\n', b\"kevin smith is like a big kid . \\nhis humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's . \\nhe grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few . \\nhe also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups . \\nsmith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong . \\nkevin smith is a better writer than director , and he'll be the first to tell you that . \\nthat might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed . \\ngreat directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them . \\nthis was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well . \\nthat is not to say smith's message is a bad one . \\nin dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god's desires is superior to anyone else's . \\nbasically , dogmatism is bad . \\nchanging the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not . \\nthis is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma's protesters are proving smith's point . \\nsmith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book . \\nbut this is smith's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns . \\nthe story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) . \\nalong the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany's aid . \\nfallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery . \\nthe logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum . \\namong the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men . \\nof course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself . \\nthey are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic . \\nsmith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie . \\nwhen harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke . \\nthe film's humor is uneven . \\nsome parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance . \\nbut many of the film's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek's serendipity . \\nalso , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away . \\nstill , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace . \\namong the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far . \\nfiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight . \\ndamon and affleck are fairly lackluster . \\nrock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith . \\nbut the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith's movies , are much more in line with smith's brand of humor . \\nbud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances . \\n\", b'five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake . \\nthe girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn\\'t see that one coming ! ) . \\nhard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . # \\n1521 ) . \\ntwo of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here . \\norville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) . \\nyes , he is also built like a tank in this film too . \\ni\\'m telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn\\'t harm him at all ! \\nthe before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability . \\nthankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film . \\nthe story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks . \\nany good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line . \\nthe film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens . \\nthere is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot . \\nwhile we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress . \\nthe film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager\\'s office . \\ni\\'m sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) . \\nthe script for this film is completely pathetic . \\nthe lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible . \\nthe only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along . \\nhere is an example of the wonderful dialog . \\nthe scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun . \\nthe line is \" my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . \" \\nthis line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy . \\nnow , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented . \\none comment from an actress is \" not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . \" \\ni\\'m afraid folks that this is about as good as they get . \\nnow lets talk about the great special effects for this film . \\nthis obviously wasn\\'t a big concern of the film makers . \\nthe killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer\\'s intelligence . \\na girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie . \\nare we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ? \\nthe continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film . \\nin one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing . \\nvery impressive trick ! \\nthe one ( half ? ) \\nplus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious . \\nthe incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film . \\nhowever , this doesn\\'t make it worth the rental fee of over a penny . \\nin the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down . \\ni would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least . \\noh well , win some , lose some . \\n', b'movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers . \\noccasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called \" teenagers . \" \\ncan\\'t hardly wait , however , does not . \\ninstead , the writing/directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to . \\ncan\\'t hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation . \\nthe main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there\\'s the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) , prom queen and cheerleader amanda ( jennifer love-hewitt ) , football star mike ( peter facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe kenny ( seth green ) , computer geek william ( charlie korsmo ) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) . \\ni couldn\\'t stand any of those characters . \\nwhether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming \" yo , i gotta have sex tonight ! \" , \\nall i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film . \\napparently , can\\'t hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it\\'s not funny . \\nin all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour . \\nand when i say \" forced \" , i mean it . \\nthey should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange . \\nthis is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour . \\nfor instance , can\\'t hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as \" i am a sex machine . \" \\nfor some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny . \\nif only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that\\'s funny . \\n', b'you know something , christmas is not about presents . \\nit\\'s about over-hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins . \\nat least that would seem to be the message of \" the grinch , \" which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores . \\nhollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season . \\nyou know the plot : there\\'s this evil furry green guy called the grinch ( jim carrey ) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville . \\ndown below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation , but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas . \\nthe movie is , of course , a live-action version of the beloved children\\'s book , which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones . \\nit\\'s rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon , but that\\'s the case when jones\\' version is compared to ron howard\\'s . \\nthe tv grinch hit all the right notes : boris karloff\\'s soft , deep narration ; thurl ravenscroft singing \" mr . grinch \" ; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head ; and the grinch\\'s wide , toothless grin . \\nby contrast , the movie hits one sour note after another . \\nfirst , there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105-minute movie . \\nyoung wide-eyed cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents ( bill irwin and molly shannon ) during the holiday season . \\nshe begins to sympathize with the grinch , who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic . \\ncindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( played as an adult by christine baranski ) . \\nare we expected to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christmas ? \\nthe grinch isn\\'t even the villain here ; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch\\'s rival for martha\\'s affection . \\nnot only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought . \\nthe casting choices aren\\'t any better than the screenwriting decisions . \\njim carrey seems woefully miscast . \\nwhile his face is so supple that the rubber make-up seems superfluous , carrey brings nothing else to the role . \\nhis accent keeps changing ; i assume he was shooting for karloff , but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon , sean connery , and cartman from \" south park . \" \\nnot knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch\\'s home , carrey falls back on his stand-up comedy and clowns around ace ventura-style . \\nneedless to say , his wise-cracking antics don\\'t quite fit the character of the grinch , who is an embittered loner filled with hate . \\nlittle taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile . \\nshe would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story ( finding \" santa \" in her living room stealing the tree ) . \\nhowever , the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch , and momsen is not up to the challenge . \\nbottom line : when you\\'re stealing christmas ( movies ) , leave this one behind . \\n', b'ladies and gentlemen , 1997\\'s independence day is here ! \\nit\\'s title : starship troopers . \\nand surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . \\ni realize that i gave last year\\'s sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . \\nafter subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn\\'t as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . \\nstarship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . \\nas a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . \\nin fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . \\nstarship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . \\nwhile starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : \" the \\'star wars\\' of the 90s . \" \\nam i being to generous to this film ? \\nperhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . \\nin essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . \\nthe easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . \\nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a \" kick-the-aliens\\'-asses \" style . \\nid4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . \\nthis new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . \\nthe alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . \\nhowever , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . \\nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . \\nmore than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . \\nand they should be . \\ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . \\nthis is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . \\nit is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . \\nstarship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange \" join the army \" ads . \\nmixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . \\nstating , \" would you like to know more ? \" , \\nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . \\nhowever , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . \\nafter witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . \\nwe are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . \\nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . \\nhowever , carmen isn\\'t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . \\nhowever , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . \\nunfortunately , rico isn\\'t interested in dizzy . \\nthis setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . \\ncarmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . \\nand as a result , dizzy signs up . \\neveryone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . \\nthe main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . \\nin reality , i found myself watching a space version of \" melrose place , \" but with better special effects . \\nan hour into the film , the war begins . \\na sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . \\nthe first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . \\nfollowing the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . \\nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . \\nmany dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs\\' attacks . \\na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . \\nthe troopers are ordered to locate the \" brain \" and capture it . \\ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . \\nit\\'s about special effects and gory violence . \\ndirector verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . \\nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . \\nstarship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year\\'s event horizon . \\nthe r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . \\nmy guess is that verhoeven\\'s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . \\nthe film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . \\ndespite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . \\nwhile watching the film , we never second guess the character\\'s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . \\nthankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . \\nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . \\ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . \\nto most guys , he will come across as artificial . \\nfortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . \\ndina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . \\nher dizzy is extremely likeable . \\ndenise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . \\njake busey , gary busey\\'s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . \\nneil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . \\nhowever , he does give a good performance . \\nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . \\nhis performance rises above the rest . \\nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside\\'s presence on screen . \\nunfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . \\ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film . \\nhis direction is fast and unrelentless . \\nhe never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . \\nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . \\nthe writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . \\nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart . \\nwe aren\\'t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . \\nthankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don\\'t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . \\namazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . \\nin fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . \\nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . \\ni haven\\'t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . \\noh , and the special effects are first rate . \\nstarship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . \\nbelieve me when i say this : don\\'t take young kids to see this film . \\nit is extremely violent . \\nin fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . \\nhowever , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . \\nit\\'s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . \\nand still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . \\nnow that would be entertaining ! \\n', b\"it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 . \\nmcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films . \\nfright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles . \\nthis is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was . \\nwilliam ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us . \\n ( at least in the movies anyway . ) \\nit has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b-movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie's next door neighbor . \\ncharlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family . \\napparently charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling . \\nso she decides to exact a little bit of revenge . \\nthis ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again . \\none of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood . \\nfright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort . \\nwhile they are stylish , the vamps in this film just don't have the personality of the undead in the first film . \\nwith the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes . \\none bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie's very skeptical girlfriend . \\nit's really a shame that her career hasn't been better since she made this film . \\nragsdale does a fair job in this film , but doesn't give nearly the performance that he did in the original . \\nroddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately isn't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie . \\ni guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way . \\nthe original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner , part 2 had more of the feel of a music video . \\nnever a good thing for a horror film . \\nanother minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare . \\nfor that matter , they were almost nonexistent . \\nif i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice . \\nthe first fright night , on the other hand , would be right up near the top of my list . \\nif i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes . \\neither way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation . \\n\", b'surrounded by hype , high hopes , and the promise of an over-the-top performance by clueless\\'s brittany murphy , don\\'t say a word looked full of promise . \\nhell , when i hear that \" i\\'ll never tell \" whisper on the tv commercial , goose bumps run up my spine . \\nalas , word is filled with little but disappointment , a kooky mix of girl , interrupted and ransom , with michael douglas and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid and dull kidnapping thriller . \\ndouglas stars as nathan conrad , renowned new york psychologist , devoted father of jessie conrad ( skye mccole bartusiak ) , and loving husband to aggie conrad ( famke janssen ) . \\nafter a gang of jewel thieves , headed by sean bean\\'s koster , kidnaps his daughter , nathan is forced to extract from his new patient , the catatonic and violent elisabeth burrows ( murphy ) , the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang a decade ago . \\nbut with hard-nosed detective sandra cassidy ( jennifer esposito , doing her best j . lo impression ) tracking down koster and his gang of hoodlums , the stakes are raised as nathan races against the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth\\'s head in order to get the goods inside . \\nthe catch - nathan only has until five o\\'clock to solve the puzzle ! \\nwhoa , the suspense is almost too much . \\ndon\\'t say a word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes . \\nmurphy looks and acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of the movie , then turns around and reprises like her role from girl , interrupted . \\nand the only real \" crazy \" to be found in the film is director gary fleder\\'s ( things to do in denver when you\\'re dead ) staggering use of flashback sequences . \\noliver platt , famke janssen , and even sean bean are decent actors , but the stuff they are given here -- such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her crutch -- is insulting and demeaning . \\nadditionally , the use of the surveillance cameras and laptops to track nathan\\'s every move is downright unbelievable . \\nhow do ex-cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment ? \\ndespite its flaws , don\\'t say a word is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film you\\'ll find this month -- and audiences will lap it up . \\namericans love lukewarm , half-baked thrillers starring big names and accompanied by cheap thrills . \\nsomeone get me my lithium ! \\n', b'so , it\\'s thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again . \\nthat might have been an exciting notion if it wasn\\'t for the fact that the \" odd couple \" of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993\\'s \" grumpy old men , \" 1995\\'s \" grumpier old men , \" and 1997\\'s \" out to sea \" ( i . e . \\n \" grumpiest old men \" ) . \\nso , \" the odd couple ii \" ( i . e . \\n \" the grumpiest old men of all , really \" ) seems just another entry in a tired series . \\nthe plot is even similar to that of \" grumpy old men \" in that lemmon and matthau\\'s mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children . \\noscar\\'s son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix\\'s daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car . \\n . \\n . \\nthen hilarity ensues . \\nwell , a few chuckles ensue anyway . \\nneil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end . \\nunlike the original play/movie , \" odd couple ii \" doesn\\'t find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters . \\ninstead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of \" cybill \" and jean smart of \" designing women \" ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert . \\nthe original 1968 movie \" the odd couple \" remains a classic comedy . \\nit introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since . \\nit was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966\\'s \" the fortune cookie \" ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , \" the front page \" ( 1974 ) and \" buddy buddy \" ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways . \\nthe reunion of lemmon and matthau in \" grumpy old men \" six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie . \\nbut \" out to sea \" and \" the odd couple ii \" are just beating a grumpy old horse . \\n ( you can add lemmon\\'s \" my fellow americans , \" i . e . \\n \" grumpy old presidents , \" to that list , too . ) \\nlet\\'s hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do . \\nlet\\'s hope also that we see neil simon\\'s name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993\\'s \" lost in yonkers \" ) . \\n', b\"some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch . \\nthen there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains . \\nthe real mccoy is both . \\nit's charmless , molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta , where the real mccoy is set , might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation . \\nthe real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) being arrested in the middle of a job . \\nsix years later , karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight . \\nshe soon bumps into j . t . barker ( val kilmer ) , a hapless would-be thief who idolizes karen . \\nj . t . also has ties to jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) , the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him . \\nschmidt , who is in cahoots with karen's sleazy parole officer ( gailard sartain ) , again wants karen to help him stage a robbery . \\nthis time he has some leverage : karen's kidnapped son . \\njust when she thought she was out , they keep pulling her back * in . * \\ncontrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them . \\nleading the list is the jack schmidt character , who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins . \\nthere is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime , let alone why he would actually participate in the break-in . \\nkaren's initial encounter with j . t . during a botched convenience store hold-up also strains the limits of credibility . \\nit would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point , but instead they run into each other the next day because they're leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment . \\nsmall world , eh ? \\nthen there's the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape , and pet tigers which , through the power of the laws of bad cinema , must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage . \\nhowever , the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police , who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day . \\nbut the fun doesn't end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne . \\nthere is also the absence of a single , solitary interesting character . \\nkaren is earnest and single-minded in her motherly devotion , but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal , and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material . \\nschmidt is a flaccid villain , the parole officer is a complete blank , and karen's son and ex-husband might as well be furniture . \\nonly kilmer's j . t . is remotely appealing , but his one potentially intriguing quality , his ineptitude , is never developed . \\nin fact , kilmer disappears during the middle of the film , just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub-plot . \\ni might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy , but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast . \\nvarious scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever , and some end with no reason evident why they didn't end up on the cutting room floor . \\neven the reasonably clever climactic break-in falls victim to this syndrome , including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts ( i kid you not ) four minutes . \\nthere is no tension in the scene , just tedium . \\nrussell mulcahy ( highlander ) is a director with some style , and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good , but he completely stumbles in the editing room . \\nthere are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i'm tempted to overlook the little ones . \\nlike karen disarming one of schmidt's henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing . \\nlike a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later . \\ntempted . but i'm pretty good at resisting temptation . \\n\", b\"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . \\na time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . \\nit is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . \\nright from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . \\na pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . \\nafter their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . \\nmcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . \\nthe acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . \\nsandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . \\nthe most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \\ni always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \\nthere is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \\nbecause the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \\none of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . \\ni was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . \\nthe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . \\nfirst of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . \\nhe's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . \\nthe old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . \\nit just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . \\nanother mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . \\ni'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . \\n ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) \\nis jackson's character then simply insane ? \\nthat prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . \\none of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . \\nmcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . \\nhow did the prosecution get this information ? \\nhow come he didn't get it ? \\nthe whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . \\nthis is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . \\nit's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . \\nat two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . \\nit's all handwaving . \\nthe closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . \\nit's not easy to make a movie about something . \\nthe other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . \\na time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \\n\", b\"wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you . \\nyou can see its plot developing from a mile away . you \\nare lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl looking for a soul mate in boston , as that city is depicted as a mini-wonderland for singles . \\nthis is a star oriented film , and the star who carries the film is erin ( hope davis ) . \\nthat this is a dating film , about singles who for reasons of fate or luck , or whatnot , have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers , is nothing new , this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films . \\nthe fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film . the \\nmain quirk in the plot here , is that hope's pushy mother ( hollan ) visits her in boston , sees her daughter's live-in relationship with a radical protester ( hoffman ) breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school drop-out daughter , who works as a nurse . \\nthis is done without her knowledge . \\nit is cornball sitcom stuff , but , at least , it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director . \\nit is easy to like erin , she is bright , caring , and attractively blonde . \\nit is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with , the financially strapped , ruggedly handsome , intelligent 35-year-old alan ( alan ) , who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist . \\nof course , he comes across as being so good ( though , he does kill some fish in the aquarium ) , that it is hard to believe he's for real , or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for . \\nthe contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as , the subway , at a restaurant , or on the phone . \\nalan's brother answers erin's ad with a few of his pals , as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way , making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her , that the others witness , will win the bet . \\nthis sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told . \\nthat we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are , each one more annoying than the other , culminating in the most obnoxious one of all , that brazilian lover ( jose ) , who is about as charming as a snake-oil salesman , who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil , was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story . \\nanyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line . \\nthe dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation . \\nand , oh , by the way , wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro , it is where greyhound racing takes place . \\n\", b'in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . \\ntaken as a whole , there\\'s little that\\'s special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . \\nbut it\\'s intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . \\nso , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it\\'s a worthwhile sample of entertainment . \\nlike scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . \\nthe formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . \\nal pacino\\'s slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams\\' sean mcguire is much more subtle . \\nand matt damon\\'s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o\\'donnell\\'s charlie . \\nwill is a troubled individual . \\nas a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . \\nan orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . \\nnow , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . \\nhe has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . \\nbut he\\'s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . \\nwhile working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building\\'s hall blackboards . \\nthen , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . \\nwill flees , but lambeau tracks him down . \\nunfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer . \\nthe judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . \\neventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . \\nafter a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . \\nand , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . \\nthe script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . \\nthe characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . \\nat one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a \" taster\\'s choice moment . \" \\nlater , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . \\n ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it\\'s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) \\ndirector gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . \\nthere\\'s an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . \\nlikewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie\\'s friendship . \\nmany of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . \\nmatt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . \\nminnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it\\'s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . \\nthe outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . \\narguably the best dramatic work in the actor\\'s career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams\\' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . \\nadequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . \\nlike most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . \\nbut meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren\\'t always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . \\ngood will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the \" good \" in the title . \\n', b' \" spice world \" is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls . \\nsure there\\'s a hint of humor in there every once in a while . \\nactually , there\\'s a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls . \\nbut overall , who cares ? \\nnot me . \\nif you don\\'t know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood . \\nin \" spice world \" they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews . \\namazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money . \\nand they keep babbling about \" girl power \" when they should really be talking about \" cleavage power \" . \\ni mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ? \\nthe film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you\\'d have yourself one raunchy adult film . \\nby the way , there\\'s something in the opening credits which says \" based on an idea by the spice girls \" . \\nwow , they got idea credit ! \\ni certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . . \\ngiving credit for simply having the thought \" say girls , let\\'s make a movie ! \" \\nthe supporting cast fares well . \\nroger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing \" chief \" of the spice girls , and darn it all , he\\'s fun to watch . \\nmark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band\\'s manager ( richard e . grant ) . \\none question though : george wendt ? \\nyou\\'d think that \" spice world \" would envoke one of two reactions in people . \\nif you like the spice girls , you\\'ll like them even more afterwards . \\nand if you can\\'t stand them ( like me ) , then \" spice world \" will really make you sick . \\noddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film . \\nwell , not the two who sat directly behind me . \\nthey kept muttering \" this is stupid \" over and over again . \\nmaybe there is hope for humanity after all . \\n[pg] \\n', b'a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars . \\nwhat is the point of this ? \\ni do not know , but i wish it hadn\\'t been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year\\'s worst film so far . \\nto attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace . \\nwing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time . \\nthe trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight . \\nmany people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game . \\ni found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie . \\nit is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though . \\nfreddie prinze jr . stars in the film as christopher blair . \\nwing commander was a huge mistake for freddie . \\nthis was definitely his worst performance to date . \\nafter january\\'s she\\'s all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed . \\n ( for now anyway . ) \\nchristopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth . \\nblair\\'s parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there . \\nhis parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this . \\nblair is under the command of \" angel \" , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd \" maniac marshall \" , played by matthew lillard . \\nmatthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too . \\nhis character as stu in 1996\\'s scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie . \\nthe three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth . \\nthis plot is very flimsy , and doesn\\'t give a whole lot to work with at all . \\nthis explains why wing commander drags on , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on . \\nthe acting is horrible in wing commander . \\nmany lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless . \\nthe acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it . \\nthe other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music . \\nthe special effects are very unrealistic . \\nwhen looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them . \\nthe explosions look very unrealistic as well . \\na ship will be blown up , but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second . \\nthis is very unrealistic . \\nmusic pretty much accompanies the film the entire time . \\nthe music also felt like video game music , and it was very corny and annoying sounding . \\nafter we are given the plot , the film repeats itself for another hour , without any plot twists , interesting scenes , or anything important to the film . \\nblair is forced to make jumps over other planets , and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft . \\nfor the entire length of the movie , it takes place in space . \\nit is truly like you are in a video game , because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long , extended period of time . \\nit\\'s not much fun to watch at all . \\nif i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships , i would go watch star wars at home . \\nat least star wars pays attention to people , myth , feelings , and has some real plot to it . \\nthe bottom line- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox ! \\n', b'disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched . \\nto see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise . \\nunfortunately , folks , it\\'s not likely . \\ndante\\'s peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent . \\nto be honest , i wasn\\'t very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , didn\\'t make it sound promising . \\nso i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn\\'t bad at all . \\nit\\'s pretty run of the mill , but it\\'s not something i would say is merely \" ok \" to watch . \\nin case you don\\'t know , dante\\'s peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it\\'s shadow , dante\\'s peak ( who would\\'ve guessed , eh ? ) . \\npierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . \\ndue to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it\\'s in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows . \\nbrosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day . \\n . \\n . \\nor at least the mayor of dante\\'s peak ( linda hamilton ) . \\nnaturally the two will become infatuated with one another . \\n ( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you haven\\'t seen very many movies ! ) \\nthere\\'s also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings . \\nand of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic . \\n . \\n . \\nbut hey , i don\\'t want to ruin all the surprises ! \\nif there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante\\'s peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself . \\nit\\'s not brain food , but it succeeds at what it\\'s meant to be . \\n . \\n . \\nan enjoyable , suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash ! \\n', b\"did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? \\nthat is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow . \\nshe is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . \\nthe dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . \\njeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . \\nhe is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber . \\nhis remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 . \\nthe background to the case is such . \\nduring christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . \\nthe same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will . \\nwhen examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . \\nclaus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail . \\nhe immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him . \\nron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . \\nwe follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out . \\ndershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . \\nnevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . \\ntogether with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . \\nsilver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . \\nschroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . \\nthere are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical . \\nyet , due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . \\nthe flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks . \\nthe movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending . \\nthe film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion . \\nthe supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters . \\nyet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . \\nas von bulow , he is brutally evil . \\nanti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame . \\nirons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . \\nhe is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . \\nhowever , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . \\nthere is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and coldness . \\nhowever , legally , did he do the murder ? \\nschroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . \\nwith all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . \\nschroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death . \\nfor all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully . \\nwe don't know what happened . \\nthat sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow's obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works . \\nin the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever . \\nirons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good . \\n\", b'natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree . \\nboth films glamorize \" outlaws , \" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers . \\nboth relate the story of a couple liberated by love . \\nbut where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant . \\nwhere bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological . \\nwhat bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores . \\nwhat bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill . \\nto examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields . \\nfor the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed . \\nthis mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity . \\nbrahma created . \\nvishnu preserved . \\nand siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma . \\nthe following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i\\'m forced to say it for clarity\\'s sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics . \\nyour plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers . \\ni think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena . \\nmuslims kill christians . \\nhindus kill muslims . \\nchristians kill pagans . \\njews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged . \\nreligion is an orgy of killing . \\nthe institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn\\'t been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable . \\n \" the state is the divine idea upon earth , \" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc . \\nwell , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? \\nlet me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex . \\nconsider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever . \\ngod takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other . \\nduring the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power . \\n ( parenthetically , witness plato as well . \\nin the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime . \\nnot coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . ) \\ncatholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil . \\nit sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure . \\nmasturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution . \\nthis is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence . \\nas further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters . \\nour culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years . \\nwe can\\'t help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self . \\nmickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves . \\nit is a straightforward liberation through sex . \\nas some good patriarch once observed , \" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . \" \\nm&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions . \\nthey saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions . \\n \" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , \" as mickey says . \\nas a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face . \\nwe are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is . \\n \" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans \" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us . \\nbeyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . . \\nwe have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth . \\nwho else has found it ? --the \\nman of today ? -- \" i \\ndon\\'t know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn\\'t know either the way out or the way in \" --so sighs the man of today . . . . \\nthis is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . \\nthis tolerance and largeur of the heart that \" forgives \" everything because it \" understands \" everything is a sirocco to us . \\nrather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! \\nas far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . \\nits alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . \\nfor example wayne gayle\\'s first report ends with some gen x dude saying , \" if i were a mass murderer i\\'d be mickey and mallory , \" in his most excellent bill and ted voice . \\non one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . \\nit seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he\\'d be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . \\nlet me exemplify what i\\'ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her \" the worst fuckin\\' head i\\'ve ever had in my life ! ! ! \" \\nnow , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn\\'t , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . \\nsometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . \\nit\\'s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . \\nas the attendant approached he took on mickey\\'s character in the eyes of mallory . \\nshe needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . \\nupon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . \\nthe style of the movie is a whole \\'nother matter that i won\\'t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . \\nlet me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . \\nthe rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . \\nalso , jungian archetypes abound . \\nthese can\\'t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . \\nsome of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : \\nmickey to mallory : \" one of these days i\\'m gonna be cummin\\' for you , \" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off . \\nsemen is a symbol for great potential and things to come . \\nat the time they haven\\'t yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet . \\nthe two of course go hand in hand . \\nfor an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs . \\nmickey during his marriage to mallory : \" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . \" \\nthe way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too . \\nit reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones . \\nthis is what mickey means by \" creator of my universe , \" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes . \\nit is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears . \\nscagnetti\\'s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant\\'s mouth . \\nthe indian sage releasing mallory\\'s father , who was reincarnated as a snake : \" old man , go be a snake , \" after telling his \" snake story \" that ends with \" bitch , you knew i was a snake . \" \\nafter mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , \" you killed life ! ! ! \" \\nthis is another telling quote because it implies they didn\\'t see themselves as killers of life . \\nthen what were they killing up to that time ? \\nin some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were . \\nin other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents . \\nthe butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison . \\nit of course symbolizes rebirth . \\ndr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : \" mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don\\'t give a damn . \" \\nthis is reminiscent of nietzsche\\'s whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil . \\nmickey : \" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . \" \\nmickey ( again in his interview ) : \" me and you , we are not the same species . \" \\nnotice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control . \\nmickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang . \\nthe wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is . \\nmickey : how ya feelin\\' ? \\nwayne : fucking great ! \\nmickey : you got the feelin\\' ? \\nwayne : i\\'m alive . \\ni\\'m alive for the first fuckin\\' time ! \\nwhat an incredible transformation this is . \\nhe got the feeling and he couldn\\'t contain himself . \\nwhat a feeling . \\nthat feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe . \\nmickey when almost caught in a dead end , \" think , think , think , think . \" \\ngo figure it out . \\ndwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film . \\nhis whole attitude can be summed up with , \" destroy them ! ! ! \" \\n', b'available for rental - october 12 , 1999 \\n10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew . \\nthat said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare\\'s work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey\\'s crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca\\'s sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short . \\nwith movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance . \\nyet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage . \\nthe first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca\\'s last name : stratford . \\ntheir family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman\\'s larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly . \\nin what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family \" no dating \" policy is amended to \" bianca can date . . . when \\n[katarina] does . \" \\nwith prom just ahead , bianca\\'s fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew . \\ndon\\'t think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister \" . . . is a particularly hideous breed of loser . \" \\ngetting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing . \\nwhen cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father\\'s new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice . \\nthe scheme they dream up is to fully exploit \" someone with money . \" \\nin this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca . \\ncameron\\'s friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out . \\nthe solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \\nthis verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison . \\nmoreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that \" hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . \" \\nthe laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet . \\nproviding a constant reminder of the fact that this isn\\'t exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy : a party polluted with liquor , a best friend\\'s betrayal , and prom . \\nit is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she\\'s all that , and can\\'t hardly wait . \\nyet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way . \\n', b'based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire\\'s latest meal . \\nnow swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all . \\nhis latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he \\nmust stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires . \\nadmitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some . \\njudging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film . \\nto some degree , i agree with this sentiment . \\nhaving read comic books since the age of nine ( i\\'m 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade . \\n ( \" men in black \" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) \\nwhy is this ? \\nfor the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand \\nthe comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . \\nthe crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . \\nthe mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . \\nsuperman \\nis not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . \\nblade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . \\nthis is in stark contrast to joel schumacher\\'s contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960\\'s television show . \\nbatman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i\\'m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i\\'m ready ) . \\nwhich brings me back to blade . \\nalthough he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . \\nthe film depicts a vicious vampire killer that \\nuses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . \\nthe end results are not pretty by any means . \\nthe story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . \\nscreenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . \\nthis is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n\\'bushe wright . \\nthis leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . \\nadd this \\nto the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an \" anti-theft device \" ) , and one has an interesting premise . \\nhowever , the film works best as an action film . \\nactor wesley snipes has \\nan extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . \\nproving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a \\ngood example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . \\nregardless , this film is far from perfect . \\nthe film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . \\nthe ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on \\nmarked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . \\nobvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . \\nmuch of the special effects are not that spectacular either . \\nwhile vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film\\'s release date was pushed back multiple times ) . \\nscenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i\\'m really hard to impress ) . \\nthe film\\'s r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of \\nrealism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , \\nwatch \" saving private ryan \" ) . \\nthe overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi . \\nstill , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade\\'s sword without deactivating the \" anti-theft device \" . \\nwesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess . \\nwhile not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust . \\na decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps . \\n', b\"saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes . \\nstarring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made , ' saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie . \\nit may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it's certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998 . \\ntom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action . \\naction , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him . \\nafter the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie . \\ni'm not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes . \\ntom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) . \\nthis time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it . \\noccasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance . \\nedward burns , looking a lot like armageddon's ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she's the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today . \\nspielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes . \\nand what battle scenes they are ! \\nthey're truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen . \\nthe battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique . \\nthe gore and violence isn't spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting . \\nthis film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults . \\nother factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90's film making . \\nthe cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william's is also superb . \\nit is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen . \\nbut while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there's one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing . \\nit is unusually flat , with many of the speeches strangely weak . \\nthe film never really makes any profound statements . \\nthis is not a major gripe , as private ryan is a film of action , not words . \\nstill , the script could of been a lot better . \\nthankfully , the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines . \\nsaving private ryan , in the end , is an excellent film , but not the 'greatest war movie' due to it's weak acting . \\nthis film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it , as it's rewarding and extremely worthwhile . \\nit really shouldn't be missed , and dreamworks skg has finally found it's first hit movie . \\n\", b\"have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ? \\nwell , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation . \\nbut after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond . \\noddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc . \\nin the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down . \\nusing an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office . \\nthe law firm's employees get a good chuckle . \\nthe audience gets a good chuckle . \\nthe eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) . \\nthere is something compelling about this mysterious woman . \\ndespite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her . \\nafter the murders , she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds' and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago . \\nafter each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state . \\nthe eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions . \\nbut he does not alert the authorities . \\nhe somehow empathizes with her sense of loss . \\nthe eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past . \\nhis daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life . \\nhis tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation . \\nshe becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman . \\nhe now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation . \\nit doesn't matter that he has witnessed all of her murders . \\nand it doesn't matter that the eye is abnormally reticent , hiding his entire life behind computer screens . \\nhe follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble . \\nwhen a crazed druggie ( jason priestley ) attacks her , he shows up for some quick butt kicking . \\nwhen the police are closing in to arrest her , he provides a distraction so that she can escape . \\nall the while , the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight . \\npeculiar . \\nhow bad is this movie ? \\ni refer you to my `review quote source' litmus test . \\njust take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes . \\nfor this movie , they are from magazines called `flaunt' and `mirabella . ' \\nno doubt , they were impressed with judd's series of catwalks and disguise changes . \\nthe major problem with `eye of the beholder' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination . \\nif it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced . \\nif it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull . \\ncompletely disjointed in structure , it's only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child's train set ) . \\ni am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents . \\nbeyond that , the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling . \\n\", b\"the comet-disaster flick is a disaster alright . \\ndirected by tony scott ( top gun ) , it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth . \\nand you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble . \\njeez . \\nafter a great opening , in which an american spaceship , plus the city of new york , are completely destroyed by a comet shower , nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy . \\nthey hire the world's best oil driller ( bruce willis ) , and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem . \\nthat's like sending a mouse into a cat carrier , isn't it ? \\nthe action in armageddon are so over the top , nonstop , and too ludicrous for words , i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times . \\ni was not alone . \\nplus , to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor's talents . \\nthe film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots . \\nthe only real reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform deep impact . \\nproducer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon . \\n\", b'silly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at \" the last stop cafe and motel \" due to heavy snowfall . \\none of the stranded is a colorado state highway patrolman ( adam beach ) who discovers a murder scene and a bag full of cash from a recent bank robbery . \\nsomeone amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber and a murderer , but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals ? \\nadam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film . \\nhe doesn\\'t play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny . \\nhis performance is stuck somewhere in the middle , and this film really needed it to be on one side or the other . \\nrose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always , and jurgen prochnow . . . \\nwhat on earth is he doing in this ? \\nbest performance comes from william s . taylor as a cheesy ( yet still somehow cool and confident ) wayne newton drifter type . \\nthe last stop is available on dvd from sterling home entertainment . \\nas usual with sterling , they\\'ve filled out this dvd with extra features . \\nthe disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , a choice of 2 . 0 dolby surround sound or 5 . 1 dolby digital surround sound , a full length audio commentary track with director mark malone , interviews with the cast and crew , the original trailer , and the usual cast and crew biographies . \\nthe film itself might not be the greatest , but sterling\\'s effort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable ( suggested retail of $19 . 95 ) makes this dvd worth the money . \\n[r] \\n', b'a standoff . \\na man holds a woman , a diplomat\\'s daughter , hostage in his embrace , a gun pressed to her head . \\na cop , impaired by drink due to his wife\\'s philandering , trains his gun on the man\\'s nether regions , threatening to shoot . \\nanother cop holds his gun to his partner\\'s temple , forcing him to disarm . \\nthe scene unfolds like a foursome bidding in bridge--upping the ante , signaling tacitly , going for game . \\nthe second cop retrieves the first cop\\'s weapon , the suspect lowers his , and the woman caught in the middle moves--in slow motion--to safety . \\nit is then that the intoxicated officer makes his move , grabbing for the assailant\\'s gun . \\nthe room turns upside down , a shot rings out , a cop is down . \\nshot in the back and paralyzed for life . \\nthe young man who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time is sent to prison for six years for a crime he didn\\'t commit . \\nstorytelling has always been one of pedro almod ? var\\'s greatest gifts and in \" live flesh \" he gives us a twisting , turning , compelling tale peppered with well-written , colorful characters . \\ncharacters who find themselves , more often than not , in carefully-constructed scenes like these . \\ncharacters played by actors we might not know , but who look strikingly familiar nevertheless . \\ntake the ruggedly handsome victor plaza ( liberto rabal ) , for instance . \\nbefore he gets out of prison he could easily be mistaken for that almod ? var favorite , antonio banderas . \\nwhen we first meet elena ( francesca neri ) , the woman in the middle of the nervous shakedown , she looks like spice girl barbie with her frizzy shock of orange hair , but later tones down her look sufficiently to pass for juliette lewis . \\nelena\\'s husband david ( javier bardem ) is the cop crippled in the shooting and he wears david schwimmer\\'s bemused expression throughout . \\nplaying the inebriated cop and his cheating wife are jos ? sancho and angela molina--no lookalikes spring to mind , but they round out the excellent cast . \\nit\\'s a credit to almod ? var\\'s craft that these five individuals cross paths and intertwine with such credulity . \\n \" live flesh \" begins and ends with a live birth and the film\\'s contradictions come almost as often as the contractions . \\nbetween the two childbearings , coincidence , irony , and a hefty dollop of sex form the key elements of this thoroughly entertaining film . \\nalthough based on a ruth rendell story , \" live flesh \" is brimming with the acclaimed spanish director\\'s high-heeled flourishes . \\nwomen are at times alluring and repulsive , their extravagant hairdos and animal print coats providing colorful highlights to the intricately-woven drama , an eye bruised by an abusive husband here , a mouth bloodied by an impromptu delivery there . \\nwhile in prison , victor learns bulgarian from an inmate and learns to love the bible , quoting from deuteronomy thereafter not unlike the way by which david and sancho refer to themselves as \" guardians of a sick flock . \" \\nvictor\\'s pre-fab inheritance is a shambles in a slum resembling sarajevo . \\n \" dear son , i got cancer \" his mother writes to him in jail . \\nshe dies before he is released and it\\'s at the cemetery that victor is reacquainted with elena--redemption , ultimately , substituting for revenge . \\n', b'billed as a \" feminist sex fantasy \" , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions . \\ncamille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence . \\nhowever , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film\\'s decidedly pro-porn stance . \\npolitical considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles\\' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) . \\nin the backdrop , however is bubbles\\' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss . \\nthis femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality . \\nin addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it . \\nwhen his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her . \\nthese proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence . \\ngod herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a \" her \" - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction . \\nthis bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances . \\nmaking her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary \\'straight\\' actresses to shame . \\nhartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven\\'t used her bountiful talents . \\nit is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of \" boogie nights \" , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry . \\nmaking a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie . \\nthe other performances are equally solid . \\ndaniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role . \\nshauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut . \\noverall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed . \\nat one point , the title character declares that \" instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work \" . \\nthe direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive . \\nroberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences . \\nthe love scenes between the women are especially beautiful . \\nthe musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70\\'s porn and psychedelia . \\namazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies . \\nthis speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day . \\nbubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one . \\nit\\'s funny , sexy and subversive . \\nand it shouldn\\'t be missed . \\n', b'you would think that this film\\'s dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and \" americanizing \" it . \\nyou\\'d be wrong , since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series : rowan atkinson , robin driscoll , and richard curtis . \\nshould you ever happen to meet those chaps , do me a favor . \\ngrab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear , \" what were you thinking ? ! \\nhave you ever heard the phrase \\'if it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it\\' ? ! \" \\nthen walk away . \\nthe film concerns mr . bean ( atkinson ) and his visit to america while escorting the painting of \" whistler\\'s mother \" to an american buyer ( played by burt reynolds , in the type of bit part that his success in \" boogie nights \" should hopefully do away with ) . \\nnow how or why mr . bean is sent on this trip makes no sense , and i can\\'t even describe how the film explains it . \\nthe point is that mr . bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble . \\nproblems problems problems , where to begin ? \\nfirst , the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from \" beetlejuice \" or one note away from the score from \" rob roy \" . \\nthen , the song choices are totally uninspired . \\n \" good vibrations \" ? \\n \" i love l . a . \" ? \\nwow , don\\'t put any thought into that guys . \\nalso , bean makes way too much noise in the film . \\nthe character doesn\\'t speak much , but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience , and maybe the occasional murmur from mr . bean . \\neach episode was like a chaplin silent movie . \\nin the film , bean is constantly moaning , grunting , whining , etc . it\\'s annoying , and just plain wrong for the character . \\nthe main problem though is that it\\'s just not funny . \\nwith each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes . \\nmultiply that running time by three however , and the laughs steadily decrease . \\nthey even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series . \\nsad , and creatively lazy . \\nas a series , \" mr . bean \" only ran for about 13 episodes or so . \\nwhy on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything ? \\n13 half-hour episodes certainly hadn\\'t exhausted all possible situations . \\nall i can say positively for the film at this point is that it\\'s almost appropriate for all ages , if it wasn\\'t for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr . bean is having sex with things . \\nand even that isn\\'t a very positive statement . \\nplease guys , go back to england and go back to television so you\\'ll make me laugh again . \\n[pg-13] \\n', b\"i don't know what movie the critics saw , but it wasn't this one . \\nthe popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring . \\nin my personal opinion , they couldn't be more wrong . \\nif you were expecting airplane ! -like \\nlaughs and agatha christie-intense mystery , then yes , this movie would be a disappointment . \\nhowever , if you're just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time , this is one to see . \\nhonest , it is . \\nthis story is about a 4th network , wbn , taking to america's airwaves in 1939 . \\npenny henderson ( mary stuart masterson ) , the station owner's secretary , must deal with her overbearing boss , an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment's notice , partly due to the fact that they haven't been paid in weeks . \\namong the mayhem , she must also deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband , roger ( brian benben ) who desperately wants her back . \\nunfortunately , her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation . \\nwhile trying to woo penny back , roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn . \\nmary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny ( i'm trying to be unbiased so i won't tell you how amazing she looked ) , although brian benben gets most of the screen time . \\nalong with the two leads , are several recognizable faces , including corbin bernsen ( l . a . \\nlaw ) , michael mckean ( laverne & shirley ) and bobcat goldthwait . \\nthe special effects are amazing , and fooled me ( which some may argue isn't very difficult to do ) in many scenes . \\nalthough the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy , it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie . \\noverall , i gave it , or an , depending on what system you use . \\nsome comments collected from friends : \\n\", b' \" mission to mars \" is one of those annoying movies where , in the middle of the movie , you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie : all five minutes of it . \\n \" mission \" * does * give you payoff ; but when it does come , it\\'s too little , too late . \\n \" mission \" has some good ideas , but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery , dime-a-dozen dialogue , and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard-cutout roles . \\ni\\'m sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with , so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm . \\nglances don\\'t communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end . \\nthe film spends an hour on this kind of stuff , building to its climax . \\na lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships , marriage , friendship , unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap . \\nthere are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film , and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know ( trying is the key word here ) . \\nthe sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching , but as mentioned by then we\\'re so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over . \\ngreat design , good intentions , but no cigar . \\nif you\\'re not a die hard sci-fi , fx or jerry o\\'connell fan ( his character is the only one who has some semblance of character ) , don\\'t waste your eight bucks on this . \\nand what the hell , tim robbins died halfway through the movie , in a stupid way too . \\nthat\\'s just unforgiveable . \\n', b\"today , war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan . \\nsteve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production . \\nthe audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war . \\nplease keep the kids home as the r rating is for reality . \\ntom hanks is stunning as capt john miller , set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier , private ryan ( matt damon ) who lost three brothers in the war . \\nspielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes . \\nprivate ryan is not for everyone , but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made . \\nthe movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women . \\nwe must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice , their lives so that we may live in freedom today . \\nfor this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget . \\nthe academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999 , as another well deserved oscar with be in tom's posession . \\n\", b'these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows . \\nmost of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past . \\nbut , some five or six years ago , there weren\\'t that many movies and the trend didn\\'t look that depressing . \\nso , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about \" modern stone age \" family , weren\\'t particularly worried when the word came about live action remake . \\nafter all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good . \\nthe plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age \" town \" of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america . \\nfred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o\\'donnell ) to adopt a baby . \\nto return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management . \\nbut , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme . \\nin the meantime , fred\\'s wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can\\'t stand fred . \\non the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life . \\ncomputer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show . \\nunfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o\\'donnell . \\nbut the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot . \\nsome thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film . \\nresult is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as \" high concept \" . \\nafter great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version . \\nall in all , film isn\\'t that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it . \\n', b'this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don\\'t say anything you can\\'t guess 10 minutes into the movie . \\ni * did * go into this one with high expectations . \\ni had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks . \\ni sort of expected another exorcist or the shining . \\ni even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film . \\nboy , was i wrong ! \\nanother garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! \\nthe story , you ask ? \\nwell , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk . \\nhe takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic . \\nlo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks . \\nwhen they\\'re finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling . \\nthey botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn\\'t really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard . \\nthe guy\\'s brother and his brother\\'s wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in . \\nthey throw away scumball\\'s belongings , and set up house . \\nturns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage . \\nshe starts having some wild hallucinations . \\nlater , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand ) . \\nsaid blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball\\'s organ . \\nthe organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing . \\nit establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again . \\nso , she helps him kill three businessmen . \\nscumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back . \\nproblem is , he doesn\\'t have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn\\'t get any skin . \\nhe finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother . \\nguess they couldn\\'t get the original actor back . \\nwho knows . \\nscumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy . \\nhe describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the \" ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two . \" \\nsomehow , i don\\'t see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun . \\nthis guy is * so * bad ( \" how bad * is * he ? \" ) , \\n * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear . \\nfor good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho\\'s horsing around with hubby . \\nanyway . hubby\\'s daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife\\'s * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams . \\nthe dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed . \\nshe manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons . \\nat any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they\\'re normally quite meticulous about that type of thing . \\nthe story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake . \\nthe demons are not , however , the good guys . \\nthe dumb bimbo\\'s the good guy . \\nshe somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we\\'re not too sure which . \\nnot too shabby for someone with single-digit iq . \\nthis is basically a \" bad jinn \" story . \\nit is an * awful * movie . \\nawful acting , bad focus in the photography , many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks , which is really unrealistic , and looks like the latex that it is . \\ncontinuity ? \\nwho cares . \\nacting ? \\n * terrible * . \\nscript ? \\nhorrible . \\nsounds canned . \\nunrealistic . \\nstory is so-so , but the impact is lost long , long before the film ends . \\ni do think the * rat * acting was quite good . \\ni have never seen rats look afraid . \\nthey should get nominated for an award . \\nreally good acting there , the best in the movie . \\n \" the envelope for best furry rodent , please . . . \" \\na \" \" rating would be far too generous . \\na \" 1/10 \" rating ( or -4 in the -4 to +4 rating system ) is far more accurate . \\nthis movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing , chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog . \\ni can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show . \\npeople were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen . \\nhad to have something to do . \\ndumb , dumb , dumb movie . \\ni was embarrassed that i spent money to see it . \\nit goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself . \\nlots of slime and red-dyed corn syrup does not constitute \" horror , \" in my opinion . \\n', b'andrew lloyd webber\\'s musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . \\nwebber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as \" oklahoma ! , \" or the slapstickness of shows like \" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . \" \\nthey instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . \\nlike \" jesus christ superstar , \" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune \" superstar , \" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn\\'t spread his message wider ) , \" evita \" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . \\n \" evita \" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn\\'t like di slept to \" the top \" ) . \\nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . \\nhere , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . \\nit\\'s also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . \\nthe film plays like a rock opera , much like their \" jesus christ superstar , \" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . \\nafter all , this is a musical , and webber\\'s musicals never undermine this . \\nthey are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . \\nthis is why the beginning of \" evita \" is kind of a let-down . \\nokay , it is a let-down . \\ni\\'m not saying the opening moments are bad , because they\\'re pretty good . \\nbut what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . \\nin the musical , it\\'s a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , \" buenos aires , \" which is also lifeless . \\nthen a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , \" another suitcase in another hall , \" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . \\nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it\\'s being narrated by a hater of eva\\'s , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . \\nfor a while , it looks like alan parker can\\'t pull it off . \\nhowever , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song \" goodbye and thank you , \" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . \\nfrom this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . \\nno more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . \\nwe see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . \\nmore importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . \\njuan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . \\na muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . \\n>from the \" goodbye and thank you \" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation\\'s people downtrodden . \\nbut despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . \\nthat\\'s when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn\\'t the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . \\ndescribing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he\\'s said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can\\'t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . \\nalan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he\\'s done \" fame , \" \" the committments , \" \" bugsy malone , \" and \" pink floyd the wall \" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . \\nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . \\nhis direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . \\nand there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings \" don\\'t cry for me , argentina , \" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . \\nmadonna\\'s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . \\nat the beginning , she looks like she\\'s too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . \\nher death , though , is brilliant . \\nher singing could be better though . \\ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she\\'s trying to hard . \\nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti \\nlupone - i heard her sing on an old \" evita \" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . \\nbut it\\'s generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . \\nantonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i\\'m one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . \\nhis singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . \\nhe does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . \\nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . \\nalthough it gets off to a rocky start ( \" rocky \" \\'s polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . \\nlike the other musical released in \\'96 ( woody allen\\'s \" everyone says i love you \" ) , it\\'s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . \\n', b'look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future . \\nsome sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence . \\n>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . \\nperhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact . \\nmaybe that\\'s where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? \\nfilm makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that\\'s why there\\'s no shortage of movies about this subject . \\nthe best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . \\nthese themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . \\nhowever , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . \\nin his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : \" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we\\'re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we\\'re completely unaware . \" \\nwhile this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra\\'s it\\'s a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . \\nthe \" road not taken \" approach isn\\'t just a plot device , either . \\nwriter/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . \\nthe audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . \\nas her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . \\nthat woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . \\none day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . \\nthe scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . \\nin scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . \\non board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . \\nminutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \\nin scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . \\nshe doesn\\'t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry\\'s infidelity . \\njuxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . \\non one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . \\nbut , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . \\none of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . \\nit shouldn\\'t come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . \\npaltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . \\nshe plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . \\njohn hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . \\njohn lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland\\'s troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . \\nonly jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place . \\nher attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it\\'s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . \\none member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . \\ndouglas mcferran , who plays gerry\\'s best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he\\'s in . \\npart of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . \\non one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . \\non another occasion , while laughing at gerry\\'s plight with the women in his life , he comments , \" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . \" \\nbut it\\'s not all in the dialogue . \\nmcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy . \\nthis is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . \\nthe script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . \\nsliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . \\nfor those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time . \\n', b'when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . \\nthe first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . \\nthe latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . \\ndecades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . \\nyes , most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . \\nbut , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . \\nthe best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . \\nmade in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee\\'s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . \\nit succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . \\nlee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . \\nhe is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . \\ninterpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . \\nlee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o\\'harra , han\\'s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee\\'s sister years ago . \\nthe island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . \\nthe plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . \\nthe main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . \\non the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . \\nin the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . \\nthe latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee\\'s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . \\nalthough two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . \\nit is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . \\nother actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . \\nfighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . \\nin many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . \\ni\\'m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can\\'t avoid to appreciate the difference from today\\'s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . \\nso , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don\\'t like that particular genre . \\n', b'i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn\\'t . \\ngeorge lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . \\nthis is the first star wars film i\\'ve seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . \\nwhat is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . \\nbasically , the film\\'s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . \\nqui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . \\nwhen their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . \\nqui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . \\nanakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon\\'s ship . \\nhowever , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . \\nmeanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit\\'s end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . \\nthere are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . \\nthis does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . \\nin all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . \\ndespite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . \\nfor starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . \\nwhat a klutz ! \\ngeorge lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . \\nsecondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie\\'s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments . \\nthis is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie\\'s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . \\nthe movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . \\ni can\\'t say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . \\nhowever , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . \\nnatalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . \\nthere is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . \\njake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . \\ndespite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . \\nthe heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn\\'t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . \\nthe film is a treasure to look at . \\nthe visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . \\nnot since 1997\\'s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . \\nthe production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick\\'s 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang\\'s classic silent metropolis . \\nhowever , all the sets are so original . \\nthe original star wars movies can\\'t even match the grandeur of this film\\'s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . \\nthe costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . \\nwhether its queen amadala\\'s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis\\' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . \\nthe costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . \\nas for john williams\\' score , i don\\'t think he\\'s done one as complex or powerful since ? i can\\'t even remember . \\nit is as epic as his schindler\\'s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . \\nit includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . \\nwhat with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . \\nthere is very little to hate in the film : it\\'s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . \\nit is the best \" fun \" film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely . \\n', b'warning : may contain slight mild spoilers . \\nrated : r for intense violence/gore , some strong sexuality and language . \\nstarring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne . \\nrunning time : 132 minutes \\nwe go into a movie theater , boom ! \\nthe lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we\\'ve been waiting to see for a long time comes on . \\nwe sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is . \\nwhy shouldn\\'t i have know what i was getting myself into . \\nagain like this past summers hit \" stigmata \" , \" end of days \" may be worse . \\nit\\'s not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some \" rosemary\\'s baby \" , along with \" the devil\\'s advocate \" a little \" exorcist \" and some \" stigmata \" here and there . \\nwhala you have \" end of days \" a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific . \\nsadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers . \\nthe plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next . \\njericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist . \\nhe has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he\\'s trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes . \\nhe seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that\\'s satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie . \\nthat\\'s pretty much it on plot . \\nit does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went . \\nas for arnie ? \\ngood role , ok performance . \\ni think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts . \\nthe thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film . \\nin the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions . \\ngabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in \" stigmata \" ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character . \\ntwo years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun \" the devil\\'s advocate \" and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also . \\nrobin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan\\'s main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child . \\nof course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn\\'t nothing new . \\nthe direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in \" stigmata \" . \\nhere we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don\\'t work in this movie . \\nthe script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home . \\nonly a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product don\\'t work as well . \\nthe sad thing is that \" end of days \" had so many things going for it . \\nthe plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing . \\nat times it seems like \" armageddon \" and started to get old and tiresome . \\nhollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like i\\'ve always said before needs new ones . \\neven with its 100m budget \" end of days \" is less than pleasing . \\nin fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over , and easily could have had a 70m budget . \\nmaybe i sound crazy , but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film , and hope that they make it as good as the original . \\nwe need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box-office . \\nwe need to get more films like \" the blair

a nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly . \\nif only her name wasn\\'t jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : \" rosemary\\'s species . \" \\nwhat a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar-worthy in \" the devil\\'s advocate \" - struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent memory . \\nok , maybe \" the astronaut\\'s wife \" deviates from \" rosemary\\'s baby \" turf for its set-up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan\\'s minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man . \\npredictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great \" bowfinger \" line about \" alien love . \" \\ntheron\\'s \" advocate \" character faced a similar dilemma , the horror there resonating strongly . \\n \" astronaut \" provides only artificial anxiety . \\nlast year\\'s equally noodle-headed \" species ii \" spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth , but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage . \\n \" the astronaut\\'s wife \" is grave and humor-free , passing its increasingly silly story off as full-fledged serious , right down to an ambiguous finale that isn\\'t even going to satisfy those who\\'ve stayed with it thus far . \\nhere\\'s a hint : it involves lots of water , electrical equipment , a special effect from \" the abyss \" and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler\\'s co-star in \" big daddy . \" \\ndraw your own conclusions . \\ndirector/writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary \" e . t . \" \\ncinematographer allen daviau , but too often favors the film\\'s visual presentation over the story he\\'s trying to

the truth . \\nhis hyper-erratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge . \\ninstead , he adds to the phoniness . \\ntheron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall - she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation \" cider house rules , \" he in the lead of tim burton\\'s eagerly-awaited \" sleepy hollow . \" \\nundeserving of such talent , \" the astronaut\\'s wife \" manages to be derivative , dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs . \\nin space , no one can hear you scream . \\nbut in a movie theatre , everyone can hear you snore . \\n', b'it is simply amazing how \" the green mile \" developed in its three hour running time . \\nbased on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . \\nhowever , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . \\nfrank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner\\'s story in \" the shawshank redemption \" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . \\nthrough edgecomb\\'s experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . \\nfrom an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , \" the green mile \" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . \\nthe plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . \\nthe performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . \\nthe ensemble acting in the film is perfect . \\nhanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . \\nthey are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . \\nthey are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . \\nthe more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . \\nsome particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . \\nhutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . \\nevery time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . \\nit would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . \\nrockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . \\nas a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . \\nthis irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . \\nthe last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . \\nduncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . \\nhis desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . \\nhis pain creates pain for the viewer . \\nhowever , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . \\nthe film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at \" the jerry springer show . \" \\nthe scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . \\nnot only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . \\nas the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . \\nhis death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . \\ngreene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don\\'t even see him walk the infamous green mile . \\nhowever , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . \\nthe speed in \" the green mile \" is perfect . \\nif time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . \\nthe three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . \\n \" the green mile \" is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . \\nfighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . \\nif you survive the first third of \" the green mile \" sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment . \\n', b'as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . \\nthe shot has tibbs\\' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . \\nto see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . \\nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . \\nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . \\nthis one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . \\nit perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . \\n \" in the heat of the night \" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . \\njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . \\nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . \\nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . \\npreceding the very original \" a soldier\\'s story \" and the recently released \" the hurricane , \" \" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . \\nthe film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . \\ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . \\nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . \\npoitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . \\nnever nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . \\nhowever , unlike \" the hurricane \" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . \\nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . \\nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . \\nhe would refer to tibbs as \" boy \" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . \\nas the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . \\nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . \\nwhat i really enjoyed about steiger\\'s character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . \\nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . \\ninstead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . \\nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . \\nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . \\njewison\\'s determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . \\n \" in the heat of the night \" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960\\'s . \\nit displays this perfectly . \\nhowever , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . \\nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . \\nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . \\nalso , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . \\nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . \\n ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . \\nhe managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , \" in the heat of the night \" and the even better \" in cold blood . \" ) \\n', b'hello kids . \\ntoday the movie studios want to take over my critical review , and somehow persuade you that _armageddon_ , the summer\\'s biggest blockbuster , is a film for everybody . \\nand remember , if a film is for _everybody_ , and if it

hundred-million dollar budget , but have cheap-o sets and lousy special effects , is , bottom line , living proof that hell exists , and has made a multi-picture deal with universal . \\nin the midst of all the action , the terseness , the one-liners , the fake sets , the overall waste of time , i recognized matt malloy playing an underwritten nasa technician ( \" malloy , give me a reading \" ) . \\nremember him ? \\nhe was a principal player in last year\\'s _in the company of men_ , a film that was more powerful , shocking , terrifying , funny , and shocking than _armageddon_ could ever aspire to be . \\n_armageddon_ cost over $100 million to make . \\n_itcom_ cost a paltry $30 , 000 . \\nneed i say more ? \\n', b\"claire danes , giovanni ribisi , and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists , but they're just about the only palatable element of the mod squad , a lame-brained big-screen version of the 70s tv show . \\nthe story has all the originality of a block of wood ( well , it would if you could decipher it ) , the characters are all blank slates , and scott silver's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come . \\nby sheer force of talent , the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they're on screen , but the mod squad is just a second-rate action picture with a first-rate cast . \\n\", b' \" rebel without a cause \" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to . \\neveryone feels that they are different in some way , that they don\\'t belong in some places and \" rebel without a cause \" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions . \\nno matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present . \\nthis is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute . \\nin our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean\\'s jim stark does . \\nnot only does \" rebel without a cause \" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure . \\neach generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection . \\nthis is because times change and in response people change . \\nno matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light . \\nthis is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents . \\neven if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this . \\nin one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults . \\nthey use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored . \\nthis scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another . \\nspeaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by . \\nthe only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same \\ngoes for brando , redford , even deniro . \\ni can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century . \\nwill dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ? \\nany film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film . \\neven if \" rebel without a cause \" has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film . \\nthe acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool . \\nnow , however , the coolness is fading . . . \\n', b'it was easy to fear the worst . \\nbegin with a classic 1960\\'s television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir . \\nscript , you ask ? \\nwho needs one , kid . . . \\nwe\\'ve got ourselves a formula . \\nthat was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction . \\nthen , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong . . . \\ndidn\\'t . \\nthe fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years . \\nunder the direction of andrew davis ( 1992\\'s under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go . \\nexpect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones . \\nthe premise is a simple one . \\ndr . richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm . \\nafter an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run . \\nhis one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u . s . marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him . \\nwhere the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy . \\nin a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience . \\nin an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat . \\non his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn\\'t know is kimble to zip up his pants . \\nit\\'s a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble\\'s situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget . \\nlater , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he\\'d be recognized from behind . \\nit\\'s these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble\\'s tells gerard that he\\'s too smart to be caught , he may just be right . \\ncredit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators . \\nthe bus crash which allows kimble\\'s escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below . \\nthe action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized . \\nspecial kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads . \\nand what a pair of performances those leads are . \\ntommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat . \\nfor the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him . \\nit would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens . \\ninstead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who\\'s just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble\\'s comment , \" i didn\\'t kill my wife , \" with a matter-of-fact , \" i don\\'t care , \" we know exactly what he means . \\nit\\'s not his job to determine guilt or innocence . \\nit\\'s his job to bring in a fugitive . \\nthis is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form . \\nthe only unfortunate thing about jones\\' stunning turn is that it\\'s likely to overshadow harrison ford , and that\\'s a shame . \\nfor his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero . \\nhowever , he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble , always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence . \\nthe fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing , and ford is up to the task . \\nthis summer has been loaded with action/suspense films , and most of them have been doing brisk business . \\nhowever , it\\'s time for clint , sean , and various dinosaurs to step aside . \\nthe chase is on . \\nmy advice is to catch it . \\n', b'national lampoon\\'s animal house , made in 1978 and set in 1962 , remains one of the -- no , fuck that noise -- * the * funniest movie ever made . \\nand this isn\\'t just my opinion , either ; everybody knows this , and that\\'s why about a gazillion inferior rip-offs have been made , trying to duplicate its success . \\n ( pcu anyone ? \\nand the first person to bring up glory daze gets decked . ) \\nanimal house takes place at the fictional faber college , circa 1962 , where the omega frat calls the shots . \\nthese guys are wholesome , clean-cut , model-citizens . . . \\ni . e . \\na bunch of assholes . \\ngreg , their leader , is going out with mandy pepperidge , but since the silly bastard doesn\\'t believe in pre-marital sex ,

\\nthe story is as follows : the omegas are getting the deltas kicked off campus . \\nthe deltas , knowing that fighting the omegas is stupid , decide to go out with style , throwing a wild toga party

pollock\\'s \" making love \" quote is famous , but in practically the same breath , he said a more constructive thing , \" it\\'s like looking at a bed of flowers--tear your hair out over what it means . \" \\nit took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept . \\nthe biopic _pollock_ , actor ed harris\\' directorial debut , reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock\\'s creations as part of the order of things , and should similarly disarm haters of fine art . \\narguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock\\'s labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema . \\n ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success . ) \\ngranted , it\\'s possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable \" purpose \" of pollock\\'s splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing . \\nthe movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions . \\nand it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film , as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion . \\n_pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons ( alcoholism , depression , and the general attendant miseries of an artist ) while finding a place of subconscious expression . \\na brief introduction to pollock\\'s raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden , awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal ) , who works from the outside-in , pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush . \\nin a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios , she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas , grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says , \" you paint the fucking thing , \" and leaves in a huff . \\nby the time they wed , she has become his de facto manager ; it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline , a most harmonious collision . \\n ( krasner denies him a baby , indicating that it would upset the balance . ) \\nsuch a union is destined to implode , and i hope i\\'m not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does . \\nwhile it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start--pollock and wife channel their passions elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years , and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock\\'s conniptions too many : \" you are killing me ! \\nyou are killing me ! \\nyou are killing me ! \" \\n ( aside : harris\\' own wife , amy madigan , is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim . ) \\npollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman ( the scorching jennifer connelly ) , hoping , one supposes , to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth . \\ni love jackson pollock\\'s stuff and i am enamoured of harris\\' _pollock_ as well . \\nit\\'s scrappy and observant ; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish , such as jeff beal\\'s hummable but no less lamentable score--i can\\'t imagine that pollock , or anyone , would paint to this music , which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images . \\none of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re-enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton , long island ; the mounting tension is almost comic , as namuth keeps interrupting pollock\\'s process to reload his camera or take a dinner break . \\na more seasoned director might\\'ve been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal . \\n', b'a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i\\'ve ever reviewed on paper . \\ni didn\\'t know at the time that i\\'d soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer . \\nas directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn\\'t very good at either ) , b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion . \\nthe plot , which has mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) planning to take over gotham city and then \" the vorld \" ( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states ) , is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust , partnership , blah , blah , blah . \\nbut morals are not the point of this film--topping each bloated , confusing action scene with next one is . \\nthe garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls . \\nsince when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel ? \\nonly george clooney comes out on top ; he underplays nicely and pretends like he\\'s in a real movie . \\n', b\"anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . \\nit's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . \\nanna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . \\nwith son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . \\nmongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . \\nanna function is to help provide that link . \\nthe core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . \\nfoster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder . \\nshe is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . \\nit is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career . \\nshe brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster . \\nit's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy . \\nwhen she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . \\nchow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so . \\nthis is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . \\nhe is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . \\nit is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . \\nprecious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . \\nit strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . \\nsome may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . \\nalthough a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . \\nanna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . \\nit shows a seduction of intelligence . \\never mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet . \\n\", b'topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil\\'s advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don\\'t know how to end . \\nit begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other . \\nthere is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz\\'s boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay . \\nfor the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line . \\nthe interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them . \\nat times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives . \\nthis doesn\\'t sound like a brilliant premise for a film - \" we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related \" - but it\\'s the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing . \\nunfortunately this level of honesty isn\\'t maintained . \\nwith about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama . \\nsuch a disappointment after such a brilliant start . \\nthe actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive . \\nthe energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable . \\na lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film . \\nit seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles . \\nthat is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock . \\nup till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place . \\nwhile the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it\\'s unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film . \\nnot just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it . \\nthis is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film . \\nas stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average . \\nit just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss . \\n', b'hedwig and the angry inch ( 2001 ) john cameron mitchell , miriam shor ,

\" came out in the \\'70s , right after david bowie\\'s \" ziggy stardust , \" it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time . \\nreleased in the 500 channel , sensory overload world of 2001 , however , the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed off-broadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention . \\ni almost missed it . \\nevery august , the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once . \\ni was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like \" summer catch \" and \" bubble boy \" that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run . \\nbut an e-mail from a reader asking why i hadn\\'t reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater . \\nthank goodness for readers like him . \\n \" hedwig and the angry inch \" is a gender-bending glam-rock spectacular packed with great songs . \\nstylistically , the hook-laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie , \" bat out of hell \" era meatloaf and \" the rocky horror show , \" without ever seeming like imitations . \\nas with \" tommy , \" \" hedwig \" tells a story of isolation , pain and defiance , but without the bloated feel of that beloved , but overrated rock opera . \\nwriter-director-star john cameron mitchell and composer-lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner . \\nmitchell stars as hedwig , a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u . s . coffee shops with her pan-slavic band , the angry inch . \\nwhile the patrons of the run-down restaurants look on in shock , and sometimes horror , hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song . \\nshe was once a boy named hansel ( ben mayer-goodman ) , living with his mother ( alberta watson ) and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio . \\nlife is an exercise in duality for hansel . \\na wall splits his hometown into two parts . \\nmother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half . \\nas hansel grows up , the duality becomes more pronounced . \\nafter initially mistaking him for a girl , a gi from the states ( maurice dean wint ) falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him . \\nalas , hansel will never pass the mandatory physical . \\nmother helpfully suggests a sex change , but the operation goes bad , hence the references to \" the angry inch \" ( yes , i know this part is squirm-inducing , but stick with me - it\\'s worth it ) . \\nseveral years later , mr . right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig , decked out in a farrah fawcett-style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women . \\nhedwig finds a new love in tommy ( michael pitt ) , a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity . \\nbut tommy does hedwig wrong , stealing her songs and becoming a superstar . \\ncut to the present . \\ntommy gnosis\\' stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him . \\ndespite warnings from her manager ( andrea martin ) that she could easily be labeled a stalker , hegwig and her new band , the angry inch , continue their coffee shop tour , shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in . \\nif this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical , take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of \" tommy \" and \" rocky horror . \" \\nas hedwig , john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being . \\nmitchell has world-class style and vocal chords to match . \\neven though the backstory is unusually strong , mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical . \\neverything is propelled by one terrific song after another and , trust me , these are full-fledged rock songs , not the over-processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals . \\nwhile mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film , there is much of interest on the sidelines . \\nmiriam shor does fine work as yitzhak , hedwig\\'s lover and bandmate , conveying a great deal through expressions alone . \\ndecked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard , she makes a mighty attractive man . \\nas always , \" sctv \" veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy , the angelic-appearing little rat . \\nartist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical . \\n \" hedwig and the angry inch \" surrounds a weird , funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast . \\ntrue originals do not come along very often ? don\\'t let this slip out of town without seeing it . \\n', b'capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? \\nstarship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that . \\nit is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it\\'s so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . \\nit\\'s one of the worst movies i\\'ve seen in a long time . \\nwhy am i calling this movie pornography ? \\npornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts . \\ni remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as \" a near-pornographic eternity \" . \\ni didn\\'t agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout \" do \\'er , man , do \\'er ! \" \\nthat sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers . \\nit\\'s * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk . \\nit tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening . \\nthe film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn\\'t appear to have intelligence . \\nto counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they\\'re clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles . \\nthis isn\\'t heinlein , it\\'s a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome . \\n ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . ) \\nthe soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic . \\nthey do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense . \\nthey don\\'t even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don\\'t care about them . \\nwe hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate . \\nhere , we don\\'t even hate the bugs -- what\\'s there to hate ? \\nhating them would be like cursing a hurricaine . \\nif there\\'s anything really hateful there , the movie doesn\\'t know how to give it to us . \\nthe screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be \" screen typist \" ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other . \\none of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who\\'s great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again . \\nonce or twice is fine . \\nby the fifth or sixth time , it\\'s worn out its welcome . \\nthere\\'s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle . \\nalso , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . \\nif a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing . \\nbut if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip . \\nuh-huh . \\nthe very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor . \\ni say \" quasi- \" because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn\\'t have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject . \\nthe bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison . \\nlike the rest of the movie . \\nthere\\'s more , i suppose , but it\\'s not worth it . \\nthe acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid . \\nthe heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece . \\n', b'one of the responses those that enjoy \" detroit rock city \" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i\\'ve given the film might be something like : \" oh , that casey\\'s gone and become a jaded critic on us . \\njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n\\' roll movie like this ? \" \\ni\\'m wondering the same thing . \\ni feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" \\nit\\'s the sort of movie i wish i could\\'ve had a lot of fun with , but i didn\\'t . \\ni just didn\\'t . \\nsurely this film isn\\'t trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \\nno , but i expected something . \\na funny joke . \\na clever prank . \\na plot development . \\nanything . \\nthe movie never delivers . \\nyou\\'ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \\n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film\\'s existence , and it\\'s not a very satisfying realization . \\nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \\nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \\nthey have a garage band . \\nthey\\'re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n\\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \\nthey have tickets , they lose them . \\nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \\nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \\nthere\\'s not much more to it . \\nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys\\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \\noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \\nshe doesn\\'t want them to see kiss , if you hadn\\'t figured that out already . \\nit\\'s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \\nwe\\'ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \\nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \\n \" detroit rock city \" doesn\\'t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \\nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \\nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc\\'s \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor\\'s cat coughed up ) . \\nit\\'s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it\\' s evident that they\\'re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \\nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they\\'ve got to make a living in hollywood . \\npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \\ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \\ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn\\'t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \\nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \\nit\\'s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \\ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \\ni haven\\'t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \\nand what about that script ? \\nit\\'s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i\\'ve ever heard . \\nif it is , i can\\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \\na plotless , pointless rock n\\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \\nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \\nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \\nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \\nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \\nit\\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \\nfunny ! \" \\nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \\ntwice . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\na word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren\\'t funny all by themselves . \\nthey must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn \\'t predicted them five minutes in advance . \\nthat\\'s it , i\\'ve said enough about this movie . \\nit\\'s a waste of time and money . \\ni liked the music , but don\\'t bother buying the soundtrack . \\ni hear it\\' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . \\nyou want to see this concept executed well ? \\ngo rent roger corman\\'s 1979 classic \" rock n\\' roll high school . \" \\nit features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . \\nyes , go rent that , and skip \" detroit rock city , \" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so . \\n', b' \" practical magic , \" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one . \\nthe film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years . \\nat the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) . \\nswitch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she\\'s not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) . \\nwhen gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts\\' house . \\nadd to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of \" light-hearted whimsy , \" and you have a pretty good idea how messy \" practical magic \" is . \\nafter seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed . \\nit is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching . \\nit is not charming or entertaining in any way . \\nand then to top it off , we\\'ve got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian\\'s body . \\nwhatever . \\nthe characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character . \\nthere is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side . \\nno attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people . \\nthe same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way . \\nin fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines . \\ni should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the \" batman \" series with \" batman forever \" and \" batman and robin . \" \\n \" practical magic \" is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , \" addicted to love , \" with meg ryan and matthew broderick . \\ni disliked that movie quite a bit , but since \" practical magic \" is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is . \\ni\\'d tell him to quit while he\\'s ahead , but in these last two years , he\\'s ultimately already buried himself . \\n',

life . \\nlester works for an advertising agency . \\nhis growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering . \\nestranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress . \\nhis life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy . \\ncarolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker . \\nshe carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings . \\nbut inside she is desperate . \\nunsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family . \\nthe third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn\\'s daughter . \\na young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction . \\nthis funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple . \\nnot one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . \\nsome of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters . \\nmost notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts . \\nshe has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one . \\ncolonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man . \\nhis rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham\\'s . \\nin fact they are the next door neighbors . \\nanymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in \" american beauty \" . \\nalan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series \" cybil \" and creator of the new sitcom \" oh grow up \" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years . \\nnot one character in this film rings falsely . \\nand the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful . \\nthe plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as \" the graduate \" or \" lolita \" . \\nkevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances . \\nhis lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age . \\nfinally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth . \\nhe quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year\\'s salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter\\'s girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet . \\nmr . spacey\\'s performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . \\nannette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . \\ncarolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . \\nunable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . \\nms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . \\nthe slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . \\nthora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . \\njane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . \\nher growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . \\nshe is the prototypical trophy child . \\nwhen carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( \" i\\'m so proud of you , honey . \\nyou didn\\'t screw up once ! \" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . \\nthora birch is a young actress to watch . \\npraise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . \\ncolonel finn is a man in complete denial . \\nhis military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . \\nwes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . \\nthe boy next door who may be more foe than friend . \\na deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . \\nmr . bentley\\'s performance is the one troublesome note in the film . \\nthat is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . \\ndirector sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . \\nscenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . \\nthe subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it\\'s harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . \\nevery nuance of \" american beauty \" begs it\\'s audience to think and examine . \\nit is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . \\nand well it should , as it is simply one of this years best . \\n', b'the ads make \" hanging up \" seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters . \\nanyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed . \\nall of the movie\\'s funny scenes were included in the ad . \\nso what do we get ? \\neve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital . \\nonce upon a time , lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now-estranged wife . \\nhis one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne , who gave him a giant bullet-shaped trophy . \\nnow lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly . \\neve tries to convince her sisters georgia ( diane keaton ) and maddy ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is dying and needs them . \\nboth are slow to show concern . \\nso devoted eve stands vigil over her father , who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia , while running her own business ( planning special events ) and caring for her son ( jesse james ) . \\n ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st . bernard for eve to care for . ) \\nthe tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve\\'s events where georgia is the keynote speaker . \\nthere\\'s a superficial resemblance to shakespeare\\'s \" king lear \" ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life . \\nsister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team . \\nhenry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays , including \" desk set \" and \" there\\'s no business like show business . \" \\n ( delia\\'s novel , the basis for the film , is dedicated to henry ) . \\nsurprisingly , the script is as thin as an anorexic\\'s wet dream . \\nthe virtue of a semi-autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available . \\nyet , the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters . \\nalso , the spaces they inhabit seem artificial . \\neve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout ; no matter how put-upon she is , we can\\'t feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day . \\ngeorgia is a famous magazine editor , and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile . \\nwhen we first meet maddy , she\\'s fishing at a picturesque mountain stream . \\ni expected to see the credit \" cinematography by \\'vanity fair . \\' \" \\nand , yes , diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow\\'s mother . \\nto her credit , though , she looks young enough to pull it off . \\nthe one redeeming aspect of \" hanging up \" is that , at its core , is a truth about siblings . \\nthere\\'s always one on which everyone else in the family relies , freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant . \\nmy wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse , my brother has the role in mine . \\n ( being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling , but it is a lot less work ) . \\nif you have nothing better to do than watch this movie , look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters\\' mother pat . \\nin a devastating scene , eve discovers that her mother doesn\\'t love her . \\nalthough leachman is best known for comedies like \" young frankenstein \" and \" the mary tyler moore show , \" her

housemaid ( julia roberts ) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of \" dr . \\njekyll and mr . hyde . \" \\nfor a few , fleeting , maddening moments , director stephen frears ( dangerous liaisons ) gets everything just right-- the tone , the colors , the characters ; all the ingredients to make a most-powerful potion out of valerie martin\\'s best-selling novel . \\nyet it fizzles too quickly ; the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene . \\ncasting is a large part of the problem . \\nthe story all but collap- ses around ms . roberts-- she doesn\\'t have the range for this kind of drama . \\nher accent also comes and goes , though it\\'s nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and co-star john malkovich . \\n ( he looks the same in both of his roles-- an incredible fact that\\'s missed by everyone in the story ! ) \\nthe very british supporting cast-- including michael gambon and george cole-- gives credibility to the smaller parts . \\nglenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon . \\nher performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and-- as a bonus-- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live-action 101 dalmantions . \\nthe biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense : there is none . \\nno terror , no tension ; nothing . \\nwithout any weight , wit , or wonder to propel the story , the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail , a few buckets of blood , and stuart craig\\'s fabulously dreary production design . \\nall of which gets old after about an hour , at which point i recommend leaving . \\n ( the pacing in the second-half is especially abominable . \\nif you * do * stick it through

airplane \" ) basement . \\nas dad declares all out war , gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true . \\ngord doesn\\'t make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in \" freddy got fingered . \" \\ntom green cowrites ( with \" tom green show \" scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green\\'s primal scream . \\nso , if tom green screams in an empty theater , does he make a sound ? \\nit\\'s clear that \" freddy got fingered \" is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) . \\nwhile this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there\\'s little about green\\'s mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else . \\nthe film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols\\' \\'problem\\' ( green\\'s put together a first rate soundtrack ) and yes , i laughed a few times . \\ngreen\\'s flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the \\'daddy would you like some sausages\\' scene repeatedly shown in the film\\'s trailer ) are inspired comedy . \\nbut what\\'s funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap ? \\na baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs . \\nyounger ( by three years ) brother freddy\\'s internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one\\'s worst fears regarding the film\\'s title and green\\'s infamous \\'handling\\' of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking as it would seem , doesn\\'t make sense . \\nby the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film\\'s end , the overall effect is numbness . \\nwhile \" freddy got fingered \" has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child\\'s self esteem , it\\'s essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy . \\nrip torn , what were you thinking ? \\n', b'for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend , there are certain rules that he needs to follow . \\nfirstly , fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship . \\nsecondly , buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes . \\nthirdly , find the perfect moment and location to propose . \\nfinally , the groom-wannabe should probably get her parent\\'s blessing . \\nof these four , the last one can be a nightmare . \\nmeeting parents is a rite of passage , fraught with unexpected questions , bouts of nervousness , the reality of being disliked , and the inability to make a positive impression . \\nif you\\'re lucky , things will go smoothly . \\nbut , if you\\'re greg focker ( ben stiller ) , everything will go wrong . \\nand with a name like that , how could it not ? \\nwhen greg first meets his fianc ? e\\'s father , jack byrnes ( the grimacing robert deniro ) , greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive . \\nwhen he tells jack that he\\'s a male nurse , the incorrigible dad shoots back , \" not many men in your profession , huh , greg ? \" \\nit\\'s definitely not a good start . \\nbut greg is determined to win him over , and it\\'s this desire that fuels the movie . \\nhe first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner . \\nit doesn\\'t matter that he\\'s jewish . \\nif daddy byrnes asks him to say grace , then that\\'s what he\\'s going to gamely do . \\n \" oh god . . . you\\'re \\nsuch a good god \" , he moons . \\nhis discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle , but when jack gives him the \" deniro squint \" ( that familiar , unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility ) , it\\'s pretty hard not to grin . \\nthings get progressively worse for greg . \\nand that\\'s too bad because he\\'s a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart . \\neventually , he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up , committing a host of gaffes that embarrass , humiliate or injure other people . \\nit\\'s a never-ending ordeal of missteps , miscues , and mistakes . \\nhe buys some champagne , but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances . \\nhe tries to find jack\\'s missing cat . \\nbut his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble . \\nand there are several other episodes , each one trumping the next in outrageousness . \\nthe more our well-meaning beau screwed up , the more the audience groaned in sympathy . \\nwe liked greg . \\nand , we liked this movie . \\n \" meet the parents \" is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments . \\njust sit back and watch greg get into trouble . \\nno matter what the situation , whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house , things will horribly go wrong . \\nwe laugh at greg\\'s expense , but love often makes a person do dumb things , and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool . \\ndeniro is also affable , tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside . \\ntheir tug-of-war is often funny , the slapstick is elaborate , and there are several topical throwaway gags ( mostly targeted at the airline industry ) to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in-laws from hell . \\n', b'seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) . \\n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \\nthere are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons . \\nthey provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation . \\nwatching \" flubber \" really clinched this idea for me , because it\\'s just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . \\nit proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story . \\nthe film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere . \\nwe meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist . \\nwithin the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is . \\nphillip\\'s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer\\'s disease - isn\\'t this rather lowbrow comedy ? \\nhe starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids\\' movie if i ever saw one ) . \\nwe learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he\\'s forgotten . \\nsara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she\\'ll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . \\nbut even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it\\'s no surprise the major conflicts here are related . \\nchristopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip\\'s ideas , but his woman too . \\nwhat\\'s worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! \\nwilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day . \\none of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film . \\nthe flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter . \\nit\\'s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . \\nunfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing . \\nflubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object . \\nmost of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip\\'s absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along . \\nbut it\\'s clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse . \\nall the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don\\'t fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air . \\nit\\'s all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes . \\nduring the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , \" i think they might be cheating , \" to which the referee replies , \" there\\'s no rules about jumping too high . \" \\n \" predictable \" doesn\\'t begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point . \\nand it\\'s not how terribly contrived the plot is , it\\'s the way it\\'s broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition . \\nnot only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears . \\ni\\'d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it\\'s almost forgivable when you realize they\\'re talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . \\nit\\'s safe to say everything that could be bad about \" flubber \" is . \\nthe only original element the film has is the world\\'s first romance between a machine and a human . \\nbut this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won\\'t . \\n', b'martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger . \\nhe\\'s also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck . \\nthey basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art ) . \\ni\\'m sure the guy\\'s good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked \" under siege \" ) . \\nof course , this one , as a change , has a \" message \" that is drilled into our mind . . . of \\ncourse , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people . \\nso why do i watch his crap ? \\ni usually don\\'t . \\ni will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man\\'s movies , unless , and only unless , he\\'s in a supporting role ( i . e . \\n \" executive decision \" ) and i\\'d definitely pay if he dies ( i . e . \\n \" executive decision \" ) . \\nbut this one has a special place in my heart . \\nthis doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good or that i even liked it . \\nthis was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la \" mystery science theatre 3000 , \" and this was a couple years before i had heard of \" mystery science theatre 3000 . \" \\nin this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine . \\nit seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land . \\naround the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new \" fire down below , \" another \" message film \" ) , and caine has him bumped off . . . or \\ndoes he ? \\nseagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here . \\none of caine\\'s cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory . . . literally , \\nof course . \\nat one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn\\'t have any options but blow stuff up . \\nhe even goes as far as to say , \" i don\\'t want to kill someone , \" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is . \\ni have no problem with violence . \\ni\\'m a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence . \\nin the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them . \\nat some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does . \\nthis would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn\\'t take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer\\'s \" con air . \" \\nbut seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message . \\ni wouldn\\'t mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence . \\nbut seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer\\'s mind . \\nthe villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can\\'t take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job . \\nthen at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn\\'t get the message from the trailers . \\nwhat seagal doesn\\'t realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn\\'t comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish . \\nas far as seagal and his acting , he\\'s rather boring . \\nhe squints , he kills . \\nperiod . \\nnothing else . \\noh , yeah , there\\'s corny one-liners ( \" i\\'m gonna reach out and touch someone ! \" ) . \\nof course , he\\'s the star , and we\\'re supposed to root for him and all , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks . \\nmichael caine , who\\'s a great actor , is just supposed to yell and look cold . \\nhe does it well , i guess , but this is no \" alfie . \" \\nof coure , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him . \\nhis big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda boring as well , but is not horrible . \\nand we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from \" full metal jacket \" ) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is , just for the movie trailers and for seagal\\'s ego . \\nand also , look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey\\'s assasins . \\nanyway , to conclude this all , to judge one of seagal\\'s movies is to judge all of them ( except for \" under siege \" and \" executive decision , \" though the latter is not really a \" seagal movie \" ) . \\nthey all have this same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but this one has that message , which makes it more excrucitating to watch . \\ni mean , if you do rent it , and i don\\'t reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes . \\nbut i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad , that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one . \\nmy ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock ) \\n', b\"it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . \\nbased on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . \\nhowever , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . \\nof course , the ads make it seem like so much more . \\nquick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . \\nsounds like a cool movie , does it not ? \\nafter the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . \\nthe mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough . \\nthe film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . \\nand with it comes every single clich ? . \\nit doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen . \\nthe characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . \\nclaire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . \\nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . \\nunfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time . \\nwith the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . \\ndespite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . \\ninformation on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . \\nthe way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't . \\nbasing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) . \\nthe number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . \\nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late . \\navoid this film at all costs . \\n\", b\"david spade has a snide , sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me . \\nit also served as a good showcase for him when he co-starred , opposite the late chris farley , in tommy boy and black sheep . \\nlost and found marks the comedian's first attempt at going solo in a movie , and it also reveals that when spade doesn't have a reliable back-up system , his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect . \\ndavid spade is not the problem with lost and found . \\nhe plays dylan ramsey , the sweet main character , to the best of his abilities . \\nthe story revolves around dylan's obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour , lila dubois ( sophie marceau , from braveheart ) , and her terrier named jack . \\ndylan believes that the best way to a woman's heart is through her dog . \\nand so he kidnaps jack , planning to stage a fake rescue , in hope to win lila over . \\nthere are three good things about lost and found . \\nthe first is spade . \\nthe second is sophie marceau , a lovely actress who's been planted into the wrong movie . \\nlastly , there's the dog , who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there's something about mary . \\nunfortunately , director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute . \\nthis kind of physical humor is dead . \\npollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs , and this procedure is cheap , unfunny and resoundingly cruel . \\nthis is where i start to get fuzzy . \\nalso in this unusual blend is ( apparently ) a sweet-natured love story between dylan and lila . \\ngiven the mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for , i found this hard to swallow . \\nand , why does dylan even deserve someone like lila , after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain ? \\npredictably , lost and found opts for a happy ending , one that feels so sentimental , gooey , and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated . \\ndavid spade ( who also co-wrote the movie ) tries hard , so very hard , to make this project amusing . \\nthere are some choice scenes that are quite funny , but the movie is only sporadically funny . \\npatrick bruel plays the stock character of rene , the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over , with his good looks and money . \\njon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles . \\ndespite a few positive attributes , lost and found just doesn't work . \\nif you're searching for an enjoyable romantic-comedy , you could do far better than this obvious , misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it's trying to present . \\n\", b'one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . \\nafter all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . \\nhe is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . \\nhowever , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . \\nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . \\nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . \\nit is edgar\\'s ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : \" it\\'s only when things are over that they make sense . \" \\nwhether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . \\nthe thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . \\ninstead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . \\nonly once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you\\'re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . \\nbut don\\'t fret , it will surface again . \\nyou could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . \\nbut you hold hope for some time . \\nthe background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . \\nit\\'s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . \\nand with speeches like , \" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , \" how can you expect to hold anyone\\'s interest ? \\nto godard\\'s credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . \\nthe black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . \\nwatching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . \\nand if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . \\nthe environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . \\nunfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . \\nsometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . \\nthe second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . \\nyou suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . \\nthe only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . \\nsteven spielberg is picked on in particular . \\nwhile i\\'ll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it\\'s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . \\nit just goes to show , an intelligent person isn\\'t necessarily an admirable storyteller . \\nthe days of breathless are no more . \\n', b'of course i knew this going in . \\nwhy is it that whenever a tv-star makes a movie it\\'s always a romantic comedy , and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that they were \" attracted to the characters . \\nthey were really original . \" \\noriginal ? ! let me give you a run-through of picture perfect : character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv\\'s friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she can\\'t have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon . \\nher boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls . \\nwhat does she do ? \\nshe invents a fiance ! \\nthen when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female . \\nhe , of course , goes along with it . \\ngee , i wonder if they get together in the end . \\ni\\'ve seen more original stuff on the wb . \\nand better stuff too . \\npicture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston\\'s character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch . \\n', b'>from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong . \\nat reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world . \\ncourtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school . \\neveryone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity . \\ncourtney is the \" leader \" of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group . \\nit is liz\\'s seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz . \\njust like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else . \\nand also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four don\\'t agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie . \\nand finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth . \\nthis time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney\\'s group , as well as the entire school . \\n>from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing . \\nnot only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast . \\njudy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has . \\nalso on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers . \\non the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but doesn\\'t match her wickedly clever performance as \" tatum \" , in 1996\\'s scream . \\nmcgowan\\'s role is annoying , but this only adds to the film . \\nshe is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her . \\nfaring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles . \\nwhen the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles . \\ngayheart isn\\'t given as much to do here as she was in 1998\\'s urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker . \\njawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in . \\nwe get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that don\\'t have anything to do with the actual film . \\nthe beginning and ending are strong , it\\'s just the middle that needs a lot of help . \\nduring the body of the movie , it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion . \\nnothing to grab the viewer\\'s interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying song plays over and over again . \\njawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless , but falls flat . \\nthe few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang . \\nall in all , a horrible disappointment . \\nthe bottom line : the tagline reads , \" even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside . \" \\nyes , that is too true . \\nno matter how good this film may have looked , it fails to deliver . \\n', b\"all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch . \\nand while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end . \\namerican pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . \\ni must question the studio that releases a movie like this . \\nthe producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . \\nsome have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie . \\namerican pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park . \\nit is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny . \\namerican pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night . \\njim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead . \\njim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' . \\nof course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . \\nthere are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . \\namerican pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . \\ni loved the young cast in this movie . \\nconsider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . \\nbiggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . \\nbut in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father . \\nscenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . \\nafter levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . \\nbut i never used baked goods . ' \\nit is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . \\nthere are some less-than-original aspects of the film . \\na bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before . \\nif weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . \\nsecondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . \\nbut at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . ' \\nand so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature . \\nin it's own way . \\n\", b'if there\\'s one thing i just can\\'t stand , it\\'s a film that oozes with sentimentality . \\nhere\\'s a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . \\nswelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . \\nalas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . \\nwhat reminded me was that i wasn\\'t choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . \\nmy giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word \" cute \" but i\\'ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a \" cute \" film here ) . \\nit takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . \\nmaybe it will work for some people . \\nit didn\\'t work for me . \\nbilly crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . \\nhe\\'s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . \\nthe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . \\nhis name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he\\'d be a great movie star because of his size . \\nsubplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he\\'s never around for them , so they move to chicago . \\nmax is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . \\nsam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . \\nsam is broke . \\nmax is dying . \\npass the kleenex . \\nmy giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . \\nit has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . \\nin one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn\\'t believe that he\\'s actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . \\ncrystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he\\'s countered by a slew of jokes that aren\\'t funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . \\nmuresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can\\'t act very well . \\nquinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . \\nshe was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . \\nhere , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . \\nall of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . \\nas my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . \\nsam\\'s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . \\nlater , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam\\'s reunion with his family . \\nand some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . \\nit\\'s icky . \\nit drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . \\nmy giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . \\nmore importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . \\ninstead , it\\'s a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . \\nand since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . \\n', b\"this is the movie not the perfume . \\na slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock's vertigo . \\nit is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader . \\nset in new orleans , 1959 , it shows the wealthy michael courtland ( cliff robertson ) sitting on top of the world , celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion , as his lovely wife elizabeth ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and young daughter amy ( blackman ) , both look up to him beaming with joy . \\nhis real-estate development partner bob la salle ( john lithgow ) proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business , while his high society friends give him their best wishes . \\nupon retiring for the night , his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver $500 , 000 tomorrow or they will be killed . \\ninspector brie ( stanley reyes ) comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange , as that will lead them to the kidnappers . \\nbut the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police , taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase , the kidnapper's car explodes and goes over the bridge , where none of the bodies were found . \\ngrieving the loss of his wife and child , the guilt-ridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop . \\nsixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence , italy , where he met his wife . \\nwhen he goes to the church where they met , he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife . \\nher name is sandra portinari ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and she's working there restoring art that is decaying . \\nhe falls instantly in love with her and doesn't heed bob's warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her . \\nsandra becomes his second chance to prove his love , as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him . \\nthe surprises to come weren't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow . \\nit plays too much like a rehash of the master's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way . \\n\", b\"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \\nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \\nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \\nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \\ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \\nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . \\ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \\nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \\nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . \\nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \\nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \\nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \\naudiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \\nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \\nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \\ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \\nwhat he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . \\na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \\nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . \\nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \\ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \\nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \\nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \\nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \\nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \\nit doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \\nthere's a word for people like you , nicolas . \\nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \\noffender . \\n\", b\"director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films . \\nyou need look no further than die hard ( he was director of photography ) , speed and last years twister for examples of his hi- octane , edge of your seat thrill prowess . \\nspeed 2 is no exception . \\nthis time , the action takes place on a huge cruise liner , on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship . \\nyep , that's right , no keanu reeves this time , but fear not , jason patrick is more than up to the job . \\nspeaking of which , the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist , willem dafoe , from crashing the liner into a huge island , after stealing a diamond collection . \\nthe reason for this act of destruction is revenge . \\nafter years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers , he contracts copper poisoning and is retired . \\nnaturally , what entails next is a lot of running/jumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day . \\nthinking back on this film , you can't help , but admire it's structure . \\nthe way , willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers . \\nthe race against time to save the liner from crashing , and of course , the finale chase scence . \\n ( although this is ruined by an over the top , one too many stunt and explosion . ) \\nsimple in construction , effective in it's execution , and the result , a clear and concise , highly enjoyable action film . \\nthe acting is adequate , although it's darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a 'hot totty' appeal to the men ( and she does that perfectly ! ) , jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist . \\noverall , speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride . \\nnot up to it's predecessor's high calibre but very good all the same . \\nthere is plenty going on , some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie . \\n\", b\"`run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance . \\nfor a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers . \\nlola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer . \\nbut , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal . \\nin these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered . \\n`run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways . \\nin addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack . \\n`lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go . \\ntykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout . \\nwith it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year . \\neven more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period . \\nas a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma . \\nher exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star . \\nmeanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life . \\nboth actors perform beyond the call of duty . \\nthe dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected . \\nthe other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time . \\nadditional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance . \\n`run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast . \\nthis is only one of the minor chores involved in watching . \\nthe other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation . \\nmost are just chess pieces in tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any . \\nbut , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay . \\na few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality . \\nmost people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies . \\nperhaps `run lola run' will recharge their batteries . \\nnot only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity . \\nlike how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , `run lola run' is exhausting . \\n\", b'rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality . \\nstarring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko . \\nrunning time : 117 minutes \\ndirected by : christian duguay \\ni\\'ve never fully understood wesley snipes\\'s career . \\nhe has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs . \\nhis best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled \" blade \" . \\nhe has had his typical action movies , \" boiling point \" , \" passenger 57 \" , but his new movie \" the art of war \" should just be called \" rising sun 2 : the art of war \" cause basically it\\'s a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance . \\nwesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n . after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do . \\nanne archer plays his \" boss \" type person of the u . n . and she has hired snipes to track down the killer . \\nwell snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way . \\nall this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie . \\nwesley snipes isn\\'t one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before . \\nthe only good role snipes has really had was in 1998\\'s \" blade \" . \\ni walked into \" the art of war \" expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush . \\nthe only real \\'good\\' thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on . \\nthe ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock \" the matrix \" , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid . \\nchristian duguay\\'s direction is also not that great . \\nhis camera angles and sense of style are all in place , but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done . \\neven the whole \" matrix \" ending wasn\\'t even good . \\nthe stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed . \\nhis placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassador , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable , that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie . \\nanne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here . \\nshe is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves . \\neven donald sutherland as a co-star can\\'t save this movie from being a bust . \\nso for an overall opinion : \" the art of war \" is a total waste of time . \\nit\\'s not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed . \\nit is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all . \\nif you really want to see a good version of \" the art of war \" , rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind \" rising sun \" , it isn\\'t a great film either , but at least it\\'s better than this . \\n', b'this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup , and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film . \\nno one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story . \\nhowever , even if one thinks of it as fiction , \" the prince of egypt \" remains shallow . \\nbut i\\'ll begin from the beginning . \\nthe biggest difference between the original , biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible , whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero . \\nmaybe it\\'s just me , but if i knew i had god on my side , i\\'d have a little bit more confidence . \\nthere are other differences as well , such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah\\'s death like it\\'s nothing but a thing . \\nmost of all , though , the story\\'s focus has shifted . \\nrather than being a story about father-son , man-ethnicity , man-god , \" the prince of egypt \" is almost solely about the brother-brother relationship between rameses and moses . \\ni was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie , where it came off as maudlin . \\nrameses and moses squabble like children and then , in the interests of peace , moses saves rameses\\' butt , even though moses was the one who started it . . . \\n * yawn * i didn\\'t care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer ( which , of course , never happened in the original story - moses was exiled ) . \\nbut enough about the differences . \\nlet\\'s talk about the movie itself . \\nit features a moses who , in the interests of making the character more human , lacks any divinity whatsoever , which isn\\'t convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is . \\nit features a cookie-cutter \" i-wanna-please-dada \" rameses , who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes ( from schindler\\'s list , among other things ) . \\nthe film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the \" new-improved \" miriam , voiced by the ever-antsy sandra bullock , even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason ( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice ) . \\nspeaking of which , it contains * very * annoying music . \\nit contains shallow writing . \\nit features extraordinary animation , which is one good thing i can say about this film . \\nmost of all , it contains an attempt to commercialize , homogenize , and mass-market a story about a manifestation of god . \\ni am not christian , but i got the impression of blasphemy . \\nthe writers and producers took a butcher knife and chop-chopped into the story . \\n', b'susan granger\\'s review of \" american outlaws \" ( warner bros . ) \\nthomas edison\\'s \" the great train robbery \" ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and \" jesse james under the black flag \" ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero . \\nnow , more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later , jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend . \\nthe story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , cole and scott younger ( scott caan , will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ) , after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war , return to liberty , missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown . \\nand an avaricious east coast railroad baron , thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) , is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value , aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who , back then , were just thugs who provided security . \\nbut when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims , jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith , ty o\\'neal , joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad\\'s supply lines , sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept . \\nplus there\\'s romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal , lee mimms ( ali larter ) . \\nworking from a politically-correct , clich ? -drenched , sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers , director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can . \\nthe choppy editing hurts but russell boyd\\'s cinematography , luke reichle\\'s designer duds and trevor rabin\\'s music lend authenticity . \\non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" american outlaws \" is a galloping , formulaic 3 . \\nit\\'s the wild west re-visited as a date movie . \\n', b'wow , a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever . \\ni\\'m amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen . \\nmany blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race . \\ni think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves , and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex-crazed buffoons . \\neven i\\'m offended by it . \\nbill bellamy is a \" player \" which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies to them . \\nwhat a pleasant main character . \\none day , his friends decide that they want to find out how to be a player . \\nwhy they decide this \" one day \" i have no idea . \\nhow many years have they been friends and why all of a sudden would they want to learn ? \\nanyway , bellamy agrees to teach , and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women . \\nthis is the bulk of the film folks , guys riding from house to house , one keeps getting out to have sex , while the others sit in the car . \\nsince russell simmons is producer , and since the official title of the film is \" def jam\\'s how to be a player \" , i was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy . \\namazingly , aside from gilbert gottfried\\'s 90 seconds of screen time , there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner . \\ninstead of jokes , there\\'s just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts ( and naked breasts aren\\'t so bad , but naked breasts alone don\\'t make a good movie ) . \\nbe sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well . \\ngilbert gottfried\\'s character serves as one in his very brief appearance , asking for explanations as to what is being said . \\nthey should have brought him along for the entire film . \\n[r] \\n', b'capsule : this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film , set in the present . \\nrobert deniro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon brando ) . \\nedward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime . \\nthe plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense . \\n , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \\ni am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before . \\nthis is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens . \\nthere are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment . \\nthere is no rock score . \\nthere are no ballet- like martial arts . \\nthis is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un-flashy script . \\nnick ( played by robert deniro ) is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks . \\nif a job is not a safe bet ( pun intended ) , he backs out . \\nsometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe . \\nwhen one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game . \\nhe returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club , and decides to manage it full time . \\nhe proposes to his girl friend diane ( angela bassett ) . \\nshe has one condition . \\nhe must stay retired from crime . \\nbut before the deal can be cemented , max , a montreal kingpin and personal friend , has one last supposedly easy job for nick . \\nnick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal . \\nmore and more details seem to complicate the job . \\nnick\\'s partner in the crime is to be a smart , but uncontrollable young crook , jack ( edward norton ) . \\njack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat , even at his associates\\' homes . \\nthe young crook is a know-it-all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way . \\ntogether they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house . \\nthe script by kario salem , lem dobbs , and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old \" mission impossible \" television series . \\nwe see pieces of the heist being put together , last minute changes , and things that go wrong , much like a good episode of \" mission impossible . \" \\nthis team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise \" mission impossible \" films . \\nthe complications are , however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable . \\nthe telling is cold and noirish , which is just what it is supposed to be . \\ndirector frank oz , the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film . \\nthe score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene-stealing acting . \\nedward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low-key by today\\'s standards . \\nhe plays what is nearly a double role . \\njack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house . \\none nice ( ? ) \\ncharacter i have not mentioned is stephen ( jamie harrold ) . \\nstephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother\\'s basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions . \\nhe seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon . \\nthe film itself remains low-key up until the time of the climactic heist . \\nthen the pace really picks up . \\nbefore that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes . \\nthough oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown . \\non the subject of music , the score of the score is by howard shore . \\nit adds tension to the suspense scenes , but never seems to have much of a melody . \\nangela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break . \\nshe has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does . \\nspeaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s . \\nit does the job . \\ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n', b'when jim henson passed away , he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success , it now seems , hinged on his input . \\njim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially , but as the last two muppet films ( or that silly computer-generated monkey from lost in space ) demonstrate , the thrill and genius are gone . \\ni\\'m not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe-filled response . \\nan all-powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture-like skeksis . \\nthe mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great \" conjunction \" of three suns . \\nalong the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay-like kira , an ogre-witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic-but-friendly , tumbleweed-like animal named fizzgig . \\nmuch of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not condescend to any viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design . \\nthe puppeteering is phenomenal--observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase--but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately-narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue . \\nthe voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone-perfect . \\nas well , trevor jones\\' score should not be discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character . \\ni suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it couldn\\'t be helped , but i wish the film was longer . \\njen and kira have wonderful . . . well , \\nchemistry , and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated . \\nthe dark crystal has a very small cult following . \\nthe weaker labyrinth is probably better-known , which is upsetting . \\na friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth\\'s creatures due to the financial failure of people-less the dark crystal . \\nthat film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid-trip episode of \" the muppet show \" with david bowie as guest-host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien\\'s fan-base . \\n ( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public . ) \\nthe dark crystal deserved ( and still deserves ) a bigger audience . \\nit\\'s the best kind of children\\'s entertainment : elegant , fantastical , and courageously un-hip . \\nbrian henson , fortunate son , keep looking back at this , your father\\'s masterpiece . \\n', b'what a contrast ! \\nin the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . \\ni\\'m not sure you could get two more different movies . \\nwhile the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it . \\nthis is one interesting movie . \\nit\\'s very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of \\'98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty . \\nthere\\'s lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men . \\nhurlyburly doens\\'t contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him . \\nhis big question is : does it all pertain to him ? \\nand if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? \\n \" it \" means everything : television , friends , events that happen . \\ni guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what\\'s it all about ? \\nthis is not a movie for answers . \\ndonna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they\\'re not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions . \\nthat\\'s what makes this movie stay on your mind . \\nthese are the sorts of questions that occupy our time . \\neven when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do . \\nthe performances are all superb in hurlyburly . \\ni haven\\'t seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can\\'t remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this . \\neddie isn\\'t a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable . \\ni don\\'t want to be his friend but i\\'d like to help him . \\nchazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person . \\ni\\'d never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend . \\neveryone in this film nails their performances , making this world real . \\nit\\'s a nasty world ; it\\'s a sexist world . \\nunlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man\\'s world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men . \\ni find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing . \\nfirst , it\\'s depressing that such a world exists . \\na large part of hurlyburly\\'s success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings . \\nsure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background . \\nsecond , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men\\'s world . \\nwhere are the stories about women\\'s world ? \\nnot the soap operas and the \" chick flicks \" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men . \\nhurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts . \\nit\\'s very talkative , intelligent and static . \\nwhile this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they\\'re quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing . \\nnot all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas . \\nnot all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience . \\nall it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen . \\nit also means that you have to pay attention . \\n', b'14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . \\nin 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california . \\nwe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . \\ntwo years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . \\nnow , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . \\nthey\\'ve been cremated . \\nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two . \\nthe premise is basically the same . \\nclark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . \\nhis wife ellen ( beverly d\\'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . \\nof course a \" vacation \" movie wouldn\\'t be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . \\nthere isn\\'t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . \\nit\\'s really just a skit movie . \\nthere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . \\nthe first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . \\nthe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . \\nvegas vacation comes off like the first . \\na good example of the latter would be last year\\'s black sheep . \\nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn\\'t really fit into a movie mold . \\nin these cases , a \" plot \" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . \\nhave a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . \\nsuch is the case with this movie\\'s mini-plots . \\nclark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold\\'s money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d\\'lyn ) as an exotic dancer . \\nthe simple fact is : this movie isn\\'t funny . \\nat first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . \\nchase plays clark griswold really well . \\nhe made the character and he is the character . \\nd\\'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn\\'t show any signs of redemption . \\nas for the two new griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes to mind . \\nthe \" vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . \\nthey\\'re so generic , you\\'ll expect the credits to read \" girl #1 as audrey griswold \" . \\nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . \\nyes , it\\'s true that vegas vacation isn\\'t even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . \\nfirst off , why did they leave off the national lampoon\\'s heading on the title ? \\ni couldn\\'t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn\\'t want to be associated with such a lame film . \\nthat\\'s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they\\'d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn\\'t . \\nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . \\nthe first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\\'s including mr . \\nmom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller\\'s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . \\nwowzers ! \\nwhat a r ? sum ? ! \\nlooking at the names , you\\'d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980\\'s . \\nwell that\\'s not all . \\nthis guy also brought us 90\\'s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . \\nvegas vacation , however , didn\\'t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . \\nthis time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . \\nvegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . \\nif this sounds like a wild idea , it\\'s not . \\nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . \\nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . \\nsunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it\\'s quite out of place . \\nstephen kessler\\'s jejune direction doesn\\'t help things either . \\nhe only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . \\neach consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . \\nwe started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . \\nnot too bad . \\nthen we had national lampoon\\'s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who\\'s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . \\nlastly we had national lampoon\\'s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . \\nkessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . \\ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . \\nif you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn\\'t anything here worth seeing . \\nif you loved them , don\\'t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . \\nif you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ? \\n', b'it\\'s now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james\\' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends . \\nstill besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown . \\nshe can\\'t concentrate on her schoolwork , can\\'t get a good night\\'s sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club . \\neverywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand . \\nin the first movie , `i know what you did last summer\\' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway . \\nto cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean . \\nhowever , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends . \\njulie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal . \\nneeding some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island . \\naccompanying these two girls are karla\\'s overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie . \\nbut was this contest too good to be true ? \\nthe resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects . \\nmeanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin . \\nthis presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island . \\neventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms . \\nas you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook . \\njulie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing \" i will survive \" at the karaoke bar and the words scroll \" i still know . . . \" ) , but her friends chalk it up to paranoia . \\nbut the body count soon starts to rise , and for julie , it\\'s going to be the worst vacation of her life . \\nthe funny ( yes , i used the word \\'funny\\' ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming . \\nthis movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness . \\nthere isn\\'t even any suspense that leads up to the deaths . \\nhere\\'s an appropriate example . \\nknock-knock . \\n \" housekeeping \" , says the diminuitive cleaning lady . \\nthe door suddenly opens up . \\nslash . \\nnext victim ! \\nis there any reason to go and see this movie ? \\nnot unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes . \\nbut i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me . \\ni was thoroughly irritated with tyrell , who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido . \\ni secretly wished for him to get filleted . \\ndid he get \\'hooked\\' ? \\nwell , let\\'s just say that if he didn\\'t , i would give this film a grade of \" d \" . \\n', b'in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just don\\'t cut it . \\nsleepy hollow has some unique features , but the script is a terrible mess . \\nfor those who remember disney\\'s fantastic \" adventures of ichabod crane \" , it is actually superior to this . \\ndisney\\'s version was at least interesting , while burton\\'s film drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights . \\nwhile the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off . \\nichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders . \\nthe victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman . \\nnow with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow . \\nsure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster . \\nin the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable . \\nno one could stop him , not even ichabod . \\nby the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought . \\nburton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes . \\nhe takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails . \\nanother pathetic element of the film was the script . \\nlike i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims . \\nhe completely butchered the story to pieces . \\nthankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked . \\nthe acting by depp was quite notable . \\nhe took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner . \\nif it wasn\\'t for his quirky one-liners , i doubt i could have remained awake , because quite frankly i was getting sleepy . \\njust when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress , she winds up doing this . \\nit just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster . \\nit\\'s too tempting to let go , even if the script is mush . \\nthe atmosphere too was quite involving . \\ni should have just gazed at the sets , and the eerie fog , rather than actually pay attention to what was going on . \\nat least burton\\'s films are eye candy , even if they are trash . \\nthe only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads , and the fight between the horseman , depp and casper van dien . \\nother than that , i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film , and just sit back and stare at the scenery . \\nby the end , i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed . \\nthis is the biggest disappointment of the year , especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this . \\ndon\\'t waste your time or money , because your head will feel hollow . \\n', b'in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone\\'s wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses . \\nwall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman . \\nstone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange . \\ncritics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic . \\ni\\'m proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them . \\ni found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone\\'s output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen . \\nstone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) . \\nthis approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions . \\nhe directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane . \\nit\\'s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like . \\ni have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top . \\nthese guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges . \\nmore than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . \\nthe only possible solution i can muster is its release date . \\nand not just the timeliness of the \" greed is good \" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies . \\nin my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes . \\nmaybe stone\\'s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace . \\nboiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone\\'s piece of crap . \\nthey both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room\\'s is much more subtle and touching . \\nand they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street . \\nboiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn\\'t shove it in our faces . \\nboiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash . \\nas i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn\\'t been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! \\nin our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it \" all \" . \\nand seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it \" all \" the easy way . \\nhe\\'s a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . \\nben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . \\nhis job is to influence trainee\\'s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . \\nit\\'s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they\\'re told to dish out to prospective buyers . \\naffleck\\'s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin\\'s similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor\\'s performance . \\naffleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . \\nwhen alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . \\nby comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . \\nthe brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . \\nrap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . \\nthey aren\\'t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . \\nwe drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . \\nas in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . \\ni know this story . \\nwe all do . \\nbut it can work if it\\'s told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \\\\ director ben younger tells it . \\nas a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn . \\nhis style is sitcom bland . \\nbut his writing isn\\'t . \\nyounger\\'s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet . \\ndespite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script . \\nthe brokers \\\\ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock . \\nthese moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn\\'t aware that he is one . \\nwith the exception of affleck\\'s brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional . \\nribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth . \\nhe conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren\\'t going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he\\'s ferociously cut throat . \\nthe jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it\\'s just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) . \\nboiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . \\nthose ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth\\'s friend and his mentor . \\ndiesl shines in his minor role . \\nthis week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . \\nin that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80\\'s , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70\\'s . \\nnicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can\\'t have . \\nnia long , as the firm\\'s secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi\\'s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting . \\nthe two make an oddly likeable couple . \\nlong is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof . \\nat one point he says to her \" i\\'m just lookin\\' for some chocolate love \" . \\nit\\'s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing . \\nunfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy . \\nthere is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares . \\nthis is okay when taken in small doses , but younger\\'s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other . \\na particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth\\'s manipulations have on one of his poor victims . \\nit\\'s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message . \\nthat message being , \" greed is bad \" . \\nyes it\\'s patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven\\'t seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . \\nand all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners . \\nboiler room offers neither extreme . \\nit gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful . \\n', b\"breakdown is an moderately entertaining , if underwhelming , thriller . \\nkurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor , taking the scenic route to california through redneck country . \\nhowever , while in the middle of nowhere , their jeep decides to break down , leaving them stranded . \\na friendly truck driver , warren ( walsh ) , offers to give them a lift to town . \\nalthough jeff rejects the offer ( he wants to stay with his car ) , amy agrees , hops into warren's lorry , and promptly disappears . \\njeff wonders where the hell she is , and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life , the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife . \\nalthough comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance ( 1972 ) and the vanishing ( 1993 ) plot wise , the latter two are far superior character and script wise . \\nkurt russell is o . k as jeff , although he can seemingly only pull of one expression , which is angry . \\nthroughout the whole film , he looks angry ( or just pissed off . ) \\nquinlan is o . k again , but again she can only pull off one expression , which is looking dorky . \\nthroughout the whole film , she looks dorky . \\nj . t walsh ( who , sadly , recently passed away ) is fine as warren ( who we soon find out is a kidnapper ) although his actual character is pretty weak , and not really menacing enough . \\nthe supporting cast do their best aswell , with rex linn as a doubting sheriff , and the other kidnappers . \\nthe story , written by first-timer jonathan mostow ( who also directs ) is o . k , if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid . \\nsome of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy . \\nthere are some flaws with the plot also , as the characters do the complete opposite to logical ( presumably to keep the story 'exciting' ) and also the fact that the story just isn't strong enough to sustain the audience's attention . \\nthe picture moves along very slowly also . \\nit almost threatens to drop dead . \\nthe picture does pick up towards the end , but by then it's too late . \\nmostow directs the action sequences well enough , however . \\nthe film doesn't really come to a satisfying conclusion , either . \\nthe ending tries to be bleak , but just comes off annoying . \\nbreakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast and director . \\ninstead , it just turns out to be merely average . \\na missed opportunity . \\noverall rating= review by david wilcock \\n\", b'making your first feature film ain\\'t easy . \\nassemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you\\'re already ahead of the game . \\nbut rehash old plot lines , tired dialogue , and standard clich ? s , and a well-intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film . \\nhow many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ? \\nthe enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it . \\nagain . \\nfive irish kids in nyc\\'s hell\\'s kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop . \\nwith teary music . \\nand slow motion . \\nin the film\\'s first scene . \\nthe kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen . \\nleading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante . \\ni\\'d like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points . \\nhe\\'s concerned about buddy jason gedrick\\'s heroin abuse . \\nhe sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin\\'s character\\'s sister . \\nhe looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) . \\nbut none of this ever really amounts to anything . \\nit seems that moresco\\'s greater concern is to provide that intangible \" slice of life \" , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone\\'s been trying to evoke since scorsese\\'s early work . \\nso , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other . \\n ( do people actually do this ! ? ) \\nwe get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not . \\nwe also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose . \\nbruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you\\'ve seen in movies just like this one before . \\nassante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin\\'s performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it\\'s almost funny . \\nmoresco , a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal . \\nas a result , the movie\\'s style is heavy-handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down . \\nnearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us . \\nwith slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we don\\'t comprehend the link to the past . \\nmoresco needs to either trust his audience\\'s intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it . \\nhis next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety . \\nif he actually gets that chance . \\nreviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage ( feature story coming soon ) . \\n', b'synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell . \\nmaking a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell\\'s army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape . \\nsullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn\\'s attention . \\ncomments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the \" spider-man \" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn . \\nmcfarlane\\'s \" spawn \" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s . \\nmcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max . \\nthe early \" spawn \" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane\\'s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing . \\nwith the popularity of \" spawn \" and the success of the current warner bros . \\'s batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn . \\nin the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series . \\nthis topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark . \\nwhat happened ? \\nwhy is spawn so bad ? \\ntodd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo . \\ni don\\'t think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film . \\ni place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology . \\nthese films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics . \\nhardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons . \\na lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don\\'t get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren\\'t engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) . \\nspawn\\'s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level . \\nmcfarlane\\'s spawn was a tortured hero . \\na mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda . \\nhaving died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda . \\nsimmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married . \\ndespite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn\\'t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld . \\nspawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so . \\nwhen the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching . \\nthe cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters . \\nspawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) . \\njohn leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . \\ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . \\nthe film , however , spends so much time on the violator\\'s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . \\napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator\\'s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . \\nleguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . \\nmichael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on . \\nmore time needed to be spent on white\\'s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . \\na special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . \\neasily the hammiest performance in the movie , it\\'s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now . \\nsheen\\'s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film . \\nmany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down . \\nmtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them . \\nflames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting . \\ncogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film . \\nhe goofily tells the audience , at one point , that \" how much of [spawn\\'s] humanity is left remains to be seen , \" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another . \\nthe music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue . \\nloud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes . \\nto be fair , however , marilyn manson\\'s \" long hard road out of hell \" effectively compliments spawn\\'s return to earth , while filter and the crystal method\\'s \" ( can\\'t you ) trip like i do \" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song . \\nfor as good a comic book as it is , \" spawn \" did not spawn a good movie . \\nspawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development . \\nit receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects . \\nmany other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better . \\nrated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn\\'t be appropriate for the very young . \\n', b'this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i\\'ve had for a while . \\nwith this film , plus `showgirls\\' and `basic instinct\\' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors . \\nhis celebrated film `total recall\\' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws . \\nobviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship\\' seemed fake . \\nbut not everything bad in the film was the director\\'s fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors . \\nit is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) . \\ncasserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school . \\nno , they have to pass primary school drama classes first . \\nwhile `total\\' was written well , `starship\\' is purely pathetic . \\nall right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you\\'re supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore ) . \\nas a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours . \\nhalf of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210\\' ( dina meyer was in \" beverly hills \" ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images . \\nthe battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects . \\nthere weren\\'t even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around . \\ni wonder what the insects eat , if there\\'s nothing but them on the planets ? \\nthere is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended . \\nthis type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can\\'t see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality . \\nbut then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind . \\nthe pointless plot begins when johnny\\'s ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth . \\njohnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents . \\nbut there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn\\'t better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose . \\nand the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid . \\nanyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league . \\ndizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also . \\nthey then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat . \\nand guess what ? \\nthat\\'s about as complex as it gets . \\noh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a . k . a . doogie howser m . d . ) , becomes involved in war intelligence , and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it . \\nhe\\'s my fifth nom for a razzie . \\nthe troopers fight , fall in love , die , kill , and try to act . \\nnaturally , they win , or sort of half-win . \\nof course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs . \\nthe bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ? \\nisn\\'t it also amazing that earthlings haven\\'t invented better hand-held weapons by then ? \\nthe only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero . \\nwell , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu\\' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) . \\n', b\"according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers , isolated motels , diners , gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers . \\nat the beginning of eye of the storm , 1991 german- american thriller directed by yuri zeltser , one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up . \\nten years later their son steven ( played by bradley gregg ) , who was blinded during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother ray ( played by craig sheffer ) . \\nhardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone ( played by dennis hopper ) gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra ( played by lara flynn boyle ) . \\ntheir unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed . \\nyuri zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by hitchcock's psycho , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot . \\ninstead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally . \\nsexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband . \\neye of the storm is impressive in visual sense , with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere . \\nthe acting is fine - hopper , gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles , but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine . \\nunfortunately , eye of the storm , which was supposed to be intense psychological drama , deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale . \\nin the end , this film reminds us that original approach can't prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities . \\n ( special note to the profiler fans : ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer's girlfriend . ) \\n\", b'sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . \\nit\\'s not the time or the distance , it\\'s the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . \\nyet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story . \\nthe wings of the dove fits the pattern . \\nkate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . \\nmerton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate . \\nbut kate\\'s \" job \" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper

\" rich . \" \\nkate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he\\'s not marriageable . \\nkate\\'s american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice . \\nat a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees . \\nkate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her . \\nit appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup . \\nmerton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it . \\nhe is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute . \\nthe three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated . \\nlet\\'s sum up : millie has fallen for merton . \\nmerton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate . \\nkate loves him but can\\'t marry him , so on the one hand she\\'s trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she\\'s jealous of them as a couple . \\na clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact . \\nat this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies . \\nmillie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate . \\nshe lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees . \\nkate leaves venice so that the two m\\'s can be alone together . \\nmerton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her . \\nhe\\'s not sure he can separate the two . \\nkate finds that she\\'s not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else . \\nthe brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved . \\nwithout revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly . \\nthe title refers to the object of merton\\'s vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament . \\none is left with feelings of regret and despair . \\nwhat started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy . \\nan interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir . \\na couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after . \\ntheir involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake . \\ni wouldn\\'t call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting . \\nas i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot . \\nroache successfully conveyed his character\\'s ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he\\'s thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie . \\nmillie\\'s part didn\\'t require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible . \\ni will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion . \\ntheir settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially . \\nstill , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over . \\n', b\"modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo's original tome . \\nadapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen . \\nliam neeson stars as jean valjean . \\nas a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes . \\nprison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor . \\nhowever , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man . \\nhowever , he runs up against one man who doesn't believe in reform . \\ninspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider . \\nhe has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions . \\nhe once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice . \\ntwo women also get caught up in the struggle . \\nfantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society . \\nher daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her . \\ninstead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave . \\ndirector bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo's novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book . \\nhopefully you won't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went . \\nthe movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes . \\nthe experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles . \\nneeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past . \\nthe supporting cast is also extraordinary . \\nthe only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius . \\nthe film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film . \\nthe novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length . \\nwhile it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation . \\nit , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing . \\n\", b'fit for a ghoul\\'s night out , fat girl stands cast iron firm with the simplistic , fatuous , built-in excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls . \\nbeing a boy , i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudo-feminist coming-of-age story . \\nfair enough . \\ni\\'ll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101 \" this is a no-no \" dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass , speaking variations on \" it won\\'t hurt ! \" \\nfor a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes . \\nthis is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism . \\nthey dare you to look away , without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children ( they\\'re mouthpieces for writer-director catherine breillat\\'s one-note clinical politics ) . \\nrather than show an even-handed evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change , breillat ( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance ) wants to indulge in her hour of hate . \\nlife is pain , highness . \\nget used to it . \\nshe\\'d find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz , other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest . \\nfor children , dealing with trauma and pain is complicated . \\nto bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap . \\nthese would-be auteurs ( more like hauteurs ) haven\\'t earned the right to display suffering because they don\\'t layer it in emotional truth ( as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet ) . \\nof course , there i go again comparing her to all these ( better ) male directors . \\ni don\\'t care . \\ngender be damned , she\\'s borderline inept . \\nbraced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd ( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice ) , writer-director catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people . \\ndon\\'t be fooled . \\nthis grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten , remembered only as cold , boring , philosophically arid , and incompetently photographed . \\nthe hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence . \\ntwelve years old , a bundle of dough with a sour pout , the superb ana ? s reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thousand yard stare and a frumpy insouciance . \\n ( her character is also named ana ? s . ) \\nsitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split , her presence is grounded and heartbreaking . \\nit\\'s a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister , 15-year old elena ( roxane mesquida ) , for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room . \\nin this summer cottage , ana ? s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elena\\'s depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance . \\nthe boy in question , a smug italian college kid named fernando ( libero de rienzo ) is a real piece of work , claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob . \\nana ? s doesn\\'t receive any warmth from her largely absent parents , who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth . \\nshe finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone , singing songs to herself , and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that it\\'s her paramour . \\nreboux commands the screen , but there\\'s only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself . \\nif one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie , at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they weren\\'t so dramatically misguided . \\nthis 83-minute vignette is something of a horror show , but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end . \\non the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members , gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late . \\nwill mommy fall asleep at the wheel ? \\nperhaps . \\nor maybe there\\'s something deadlier around the corner , lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl . \\nwhat\\'s more , she might even like it . \\nwith the intent of being unfair and unpredictable , placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood , breillat\\'s extreme flourish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt . \\nfat girl is a bitter pill indeed . \\naka ? ma soeur ! \\nscreened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) . \\n', b'harmless , silly and fun comedy about dim-witted wrestling fans gordie and sean ( david arquette and scott caan ) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king ( oliver platt ) . \\nwhen king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter ( joe pantoliano ) , gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory . \\nmy biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on , as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed ( but not fake , mind you ) . \\nthe hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that . \\narquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances , which is exactly what a movie like this requires , and oliver platt ( one of my favorite actors ) is a riot as the drunken washed-up ex-champion . \\nmany have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record , but for me it just added to the \" silly factor \" of the film , thereby increasing my enjoyment of it . \\none casting complaint however : rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer ? \\nplease . . . \\nif rose mcgowan is sexy then i\\'m marilyn manson . \\ngiven the current state of the actual wcw , if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming , he\\'d be the most popular guy they have . \\non a similar note , the \" plot line \" of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years . \\nalthough one does have to ask . . . \\nwhy would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans ? \\ndirector brian robbins ( you\\'ll remember him as eric from tv\\'s \" head of the class \" ) just knows how to make good dumb movies . \\nthis movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues . \\nand screenwriter steven brill ( the epic mighty ducks trilogy , late last night ) manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time , with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me . \\nthe only exceptions to that were : 1 ) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and 2 ) any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan . \\nthose moments made me cringe and/or groan . \\nas an added bonus though , the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll . \\n[pg-13] \\n', b'plot : lara croft is british , rich and kicks a lot of ass . \\nshe also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are

of tight shirts . . . hummana-hummana-hummana . . . \\ncritique : angelina jolie was great in this movie . \\nthere were also about three \" action scenes \" that were pretty cool to look at in this film . \\nuhhhhhm , unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked ! \\nbad dialogue , generic sidekicks and bad guys , a lame mystery , yoda-esque moments with mumbo-jumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end . \\nall in all , this movie wasn\\'t the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about , especially since every other scene does feature jolie\\'s torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts , but it was quite the letdown nonetheless , especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create a cool , hip woman hero , based on a popular video game . \\ni don\\'t know , i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west , who didn\\'t really tie the whole movie together all that well . \\nthe film lacked energy , a consistent pace and well . . . a \\nfun time ! \\ni felt kinda depressed while watching this movie . \\nall that \" father \" crap was horrible and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing ( and i\\'m not even gonna mention his moustache . . . hehehe ) . \\nwhy have this shite in the movie at all ? ! ? \\ni especially hated the scenes in which some ghost-like figure , friend or child would ramble on about lara croft\\'s father while all the time , i\\'m not giving one ounce of crap as to what they\\'re talking about . \\ni guess that\\'s called lack of \" character development \" , right ? \\nthat\\'s when a movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen , so that we could actually \" get into \" it and care about them . \\ni didn\\'t care about anyone in this movie , and was bored during most of its \" let\\'s explain why we\\'re doing all this gobbledygook \" moments . \\nand even though i thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass ( damn , did she look sexy blasting those guns or what ? ! ? ) , everybody else around her was so goddamn boring ! \\nher butler was a throwaway with no personality , her side-kick was supposed to be funny but just annoyed me every time he said the word \" bugger \" ( and he says it a lot , trust me ! ) and all of the so-called bad guys just spewed one-dimension ! \\nthey had no spark , no energy amongst them , and even though a few of the action scenes in the movie were cool ( see the trailer and you\\'ll know which ones i\\'m talking about ) , the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bull-crap just buried it even further . \\nalso , for a movie that\\'s supposed to be about all of these exotic locations , i wasn\\'t necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots , and even less so with its interiors , which all looked like they were shot in the same room . \\nmind you , i won\\'t go as far as to say that it\\'s the \" worst movie of the year \" ( remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr . movies also ! ) , but it\\'s definitely the worst film that i\\'ve seen during this summer movie season ( of course , it\\'s still early and i\\'m sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike ) . \\nskip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead . . . trust \\nme , you\\'ll miss the boobs but end your night with some rock-solid porn and it\\'s all good ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nraiders of the lost ark ( 10/10 ) - the mummy ( 8/10 ) - lost in space ( 7/10 ) - the mummy returns ( 6/10 ) - the general\\'s daughter ( 3/10 ) - romancing the stone ( 7/10 ) - wild wild west ( 3/10 ) - mission impossible 2 ( 7/10 ) \\n', b'the tagline for this film is : \" some houses are just born bad \" . \\nso i didn\\'t expect too much from this . \\nbut i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . \\ni thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . \\ni thought , mabe it will be fun ? \\nand in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . \\nbut by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . \\nthese great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . \\nhere is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . \\namong them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . \\nactually , the doctor is researching the \" primordial fear reaction \" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens . \\nbut he gets unexpected help from the house itself . \\nit rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . \\nportals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . \\na fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . \\nfilmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . \\nbut the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . \\nthe second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . \\nis that exciting or what ? \\nthe worst thing about it is that it didn\\'t have to be bad . \\nit\\'s based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , \\'\\' by shirley jackson . \\na 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . \\nit played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . \\n \" the blair witch project \" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . \\nand with a $70 mill . \\nbudget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . \\nde bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . \\nhe is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . \\nbut why give him a more serious material ? \\nin the end \" haunting \" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont\\'s career as a director . \\nyet it wouldn\\'t be fair to say that everything is bad . \\nthe effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . \\nbut this is where the good things end . \\nthe music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life . \\nit\\'s nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn\\'t engage . \\nat first you do not know what\\'s going on . \\nis this part of the experiment ? \\nare these hallucinations ? \\nprojections of the subconscience ? \\nparanoia ? \\nbut in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . \\nthe house is actually possessed . \\nit is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . \\nfor ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that\\'s what i got ? \\ni believe hichock once said that \" it\\'s better to wait for a climax , than to see one \" . \\nthis may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid . \\nthey are impossible to take seriously . \\nany paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick\\'s \" the shining \" , are absolutely baseless . \\n \" shining \" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality . \\n \" haunting \" has only special effects and art direction to boast of . \\nand those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . \\ncasting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse . \\nbut i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : \" some films are just born stupid \" . \\n', b' \" nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy \" \\nshowgirls ( nc-17 ) - contains graphic nudity , profanity , sexual situations and violence . \\nsome people , however , keep their clothes on . \\nyou do not watch porn films for their intellectual values , nor do you write reviews on them . \\nthat\\'s why this review will be short . \\nit seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores . \\nthere is no story , script , point or acting . \\nonly naked bodies , which is exactly the point . \\nhere is the so called plot : nomi , the 23-year-old with a dark past as a hooker , has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesn\\'t wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big , fake smile . \\nno one is twisting nomi\\'s arm . \\nno one is holding her grandmother hostage . \\nshe wants to do this . \\nand that is what she is doing till the end credits . \\nso what\\'s the problem then ? \\nwhat\\'s the point ? \\nwhat\\'s the film about ? \\nis there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy ? \\nthis film can be described in one sentence : obscene level of incompetence , excessive stupidity in the story line , gross negligence of the viewer\\'s intelligence , a prurient interest in the quick buck . \\nbelieve me , after an hour with these characters , acting and script , you\\'ll start hoping for someone to kill somebody . \\nelizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film , that is bad even for eszterhas\\' script . \\nher character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better . \\nher character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry , selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public . \\n \" i am not a whore ! \\ni am a dancer \" , she screams , but does it in such an over dramatized way that you\\'ll start laughing . \\nin fact the acting in \" showgirls \" brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level . \\nnot one single achievement , besides the conventional cinematography , is worth mentioning . \\nit is a total waste of time and money . \\nthere is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence . \\nthe dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another . \\nits attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe . \\n \" in my films , \" writes director paul verhoeven ( \\'basic instinct\\' , \\'total recall\\' ) , \" i hold the mirror up to life . \" \\nwell , excuse me ? \\nhis attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas , and as he put it \" show the naked truth \" , is simplified and unreal . \\noccasionally , between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities , screenwriter joe eszterhas ( the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history ) inserts some lines of deep morality , that sound something like this : \" hey , i see you . \\ni see that you\\'re hiding \" - \" from what ? \" \\n- \" from you \" . \\nyes , and even the only decent line in this film : \" nomi is what las vegas is all about \" can\\'t save \\'showgirls\\' from going under . \\nit\\'s a strange phenomena . \\nit\\'s not erotic , because it lacks sensuality . \\nnot dramatic , because it lacks the acting . \\nand not intelligent because it lacks a story . \\nit is simply verhoven\\'s bad excuse for making pornography . \\nyou want to see naked women ? \\nbare breasts ? \\nfull frontals ? \\nit\\'s nothing wrong with that . \\nbut in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store , and not waste time surviving through eszterhas\\' pathetic dialogue . \\nb qualities , while it\\'s only a high budget porn-film . \\n', b\"die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect . \\nplace the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film's pathetic screenplay . \\nevery line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor . \\nthe plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land . \\nthe film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut-outs . \\nso much for the script . \\nhow about the action ? \\nwell , let's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator--all standouts for their hair-raising suspense . \\nby contrast , harlin doesn't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam . \\ndie harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute . \\nin fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it's good . \\nyou do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it . \\ndie hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff . \\n\", b'plot : something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non-horror movies . \\noh yeah , there\\'s also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit , but trust me , you won\\'t care much about the \" plot \" in this film . . . \\ncritique : parody movies either work or they don\\'t and this one just doesn\\'t work ! \\nthe laughs aren\\'t as pronounced this time around , the energy level , the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here . \\nit\\'s like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something ( wink , wink ) . \\nand the scariest part of it all ? \\ncheck out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy : seven ! \\ni say again , it took seven people to write 82-minutes worth of fart jokes , half-assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror . \\nnow i\\'m not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed \" funny sketch \" ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves , but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on \" saturday night live \" . \\nthere are a couple of funny one-liners , but mostly just rehashed one-joke scenes , a lot of dead silence and lame gags . \\nadd to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here ( the film\\'s website isn\\'t even up yet ! ! ! \\nwhat the f * * * ? ! ? ) . \\ni do however have to give it up to james woods , the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all ( the exorcist take-off-- miss this and you\\'ve missed any reason to see the flick ) . \\ni especially liked his one-liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman\\'s head turning . \\nvery funny ! \\nunfortunately , the film plummets straight down after that , with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude , where\\'s my car , and other action movies like charlie\\'s angels and mission impossible 2 . now help me figure this one out , will you ? \\nisn\\'t this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies ? ! ? \\n ( or maybe that\\'s just the title of the film f-ing with my head ) . \\nwell , i\\'m sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame-ass script ! \\nthe wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers ( money ) instead of the zucker brothers ( comedy ) for this sequel . \\nunfortunately for us , all we\\'re left with here is a skeleton of a film which might\\'ve been funny , had it been worked over a few more times , tightened up here and there , and been injected with more solid laughs . \\nbut as things stand now , there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year\\'s film has led everyone down this path , so screw them for not trying as hard ( critically speaking , of course ) . \\nyou should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough \" real \" effort into this chop-job and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents . \\npooh on you ! \\n ( that\\'s telling \\'em , joblo ! \\nsheesh ) \\nbtw , i\\'m allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson , whose massive breasts and skanky g-string had me chompin\\' at the bit . \\nyou go , girl ! \\neveryone else . . . stay !

prepostrous thriller that\\'s also one of the year\\'s most enjoyable . \\nit\\'s an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it . \\nthere is not a moment here when the events on screen don\\'t have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops . \\nit has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that\\'s probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones . \\nnot even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake . \\nwe meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4 . they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin\\' sex , they go to sleep . \\nlibby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood . \\nshe follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up . \\nat that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested . \\nher lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling . \\nher friend adopts her son and she goes to prison . \\nonce in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend . \\nher friend gives her son the phone . \\nnick walks in the room . \\nlittle matty screams \" daddy ! \" \\nthe phone goes dead . \\nlibby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn\\'t even dead . \\nshe gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can\\'t convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can\\'t touch her . \\nafter a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole . \\nshe is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) . \\nshe sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated . \\nshe winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son\\'s \" adopter \" . \\ndouble jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false . \\nthe law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances . \\nit\\'s not like it matters . \\nthis is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious . \\nit\\'s silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don\\'t question . \\nin some films , plausibility is everything . \\ndouble jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does . \\njudd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role . \\nthis is her breakout box-office performance , and she is terrific . \\nshe brings some emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces . \\ntommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone-faced wit . \\nthankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film\\'s story . \\nthis is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that . \\nthe sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book . \\nafter all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops , deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system , it\\'s great to see a movie that doesn\\'t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure . \\ndouble jeopardy is really good , but it isn\\'t the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards . \\nit\\'s one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off , otherwise , your brain will be busy ruining your experience . \\nthis is a thriller that isn\\'t concerned with being smart or plausible . \\ninstead it diverts all attention to the action , which , this year , is second to none . \\n', b\"you've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . \\nthe difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care . \\nthe hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . \\nthe seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . \\ndesperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . \\nthe preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . \\nonly after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time . \\nmalcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . \\nhe will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . \\nthe sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . \\n ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) \\nit's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . \\ncole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . \\nperhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old . \\nthat's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar . \\nwe appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . \\nboth actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest . \\nwillis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . \\nosment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . \\nthe sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading . \\nonly because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours . \\nthe story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . \\ni'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity . \\n\", b'where do i begin ? \\nokay , how about with this : starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time . \\nin fact , it might even be the worst * major * release film to come out in years . . . \\nor even a decade . \\nthis is bad beyond belief . \\ni would * not * suggest paying money to see this . \\nthere\\'s a good chance you\\'ll regret it . \\nif you see it for free , you could still want to walk out . \\ngo right ahead . \\nthe movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of . . . buenos aires . \\nhere we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious , easy-to- * despise * -with-a-passion characters that have love triangles , love rectangles , and love hexagons screwing up their life . \\nbefore long they all go off and join the military , primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined . \\nthey train . \\nthey strut around nude for no reason whatsoever . \\nafter an hour of making the audience scream in agony , they start fighting bugs . \\nthe big bugs look nice , even though their design is only \" okay . \" \\nunfortunately , the fights are boring since we * want * all of the characters dead anyway . \\ncue more agony . \\nthen some characters have sex . \\nthen some more die . \\n * * * who cares ? ? ? * * * \\ncue more agony . \\nthe movie ends , the audience runs out to their cars , vomits over the pavement , and attempts to drive home . \\nunfortunately , after that torture , they can\\'t think straight , don\\'t pay attention to the road , and many are in ugly car wrecks . \\nyou remember how batman & robin was bad ? \\nwell , batman & robin kicked this movie\\'s sorry butt , people . \\nstarship troopers does not succeed as an action movie . \\nit does not succeed as a drama . \\nit does not succeed as a war movie . \\nit does not succeed as a comedy . \\nit does not succeed as a satire . \\nit does not succeed as a parody . \\nit succeeds as being horrible . \\nterrible . \\ngut-wrenchingly bad . \\ni wanted to run away from that movie every minute . \\nbut i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better . \\nso i stayed . \\nit never got better . \\nfrequently , it did the impossible , and got * worse * . \\nthe movie as written , acted , directed , and basically just feels as a whole like it\\'s about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4 . the whole thing feels like a movie that only three-year-olds could enjoy . . . \\nexcept for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore , and pointless nudity . \\nit\\'s written for little children , but children should definitely * not * go anywhere near it . \\nof course , i recommend the same for everyone . \\ndon\\'t go anywhere near it . \\nverhoeven\\'s got a streak going now . \\nhis last movie was showgirls . \\nhe seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming . \\nshowgirls was a failure , but it appears that , though it\\'ll be lucky to make near its budget , this movie will still do okay gross-wise . \\nis it really * all * bad ? \\nwell , no . \\ntroopers has about four or five lines of dialouge/short humorous scenes that are actually funny , mostly from the \" do you want to know more ? \" \\ncommercials that pop up throughout the story , promoting the joys of the joining the troopers . \\nso that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour , 59 minutes , and 30 seconds of miserable torture . \\ni\\'m totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie . \\nbut i do admit it . \\nso , if you\\'re willing to possibly put yourself through torture , go ahead and see it , and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it . \\ni don\\'t know how anyone or any * thing * could love this movie , but hey , to each his own . \\nfeel free to give it a shot . \\nof course , in the interest of saving your souls , i don\\'t recommend it . \\nbut guess what ? \\nalien resurrection comes out november 26th , and , having already seen some of it and having read the script , i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away . \\nthough opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split , it\\'ll be difficult to find someone that * won\\'t * like alien resurrection when they\\'ve seen it . \\nthis is possibly the year\\'s best intense action film , or at least * one * of the best . \\nif you really want to see alien warfare that\\'s played out intelligently and seriously , see alien resurrection . \\nplease , avoid this . \\n', b\"in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster . \\ndespite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department . \\nin terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age . \\nshe is one ? hot' babe who defines true ? woman leadership' . \\nshe not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination . \\nno thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything . \\nthe young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero . \\nin fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners . \\ni mean it would be interesting to see yoda's girlfriend for a change , if he has one . \\nnot much better is qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods , and has a better hair do than obi-wan , but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life . \\nalso fascinating is george lucas ? metoclorian' theory , which claims that micro-organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe . \\nand it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force . \\nmore humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader , no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith , except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force . \\noverall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it's predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor . \\nby all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan . \\nwatch out for the next one , it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker - who i believe should be portrayed by ? leonardo di caprio . \\n\", b'glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war . \\nbroderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle . \\nshaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society . \\nthe letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory . \\nas the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces . \\nlike private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces . \\nshaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck . \\nsoon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort . \\nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . \\nthe film periodically jumps between shaw\\'s point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . \\nthe movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . \\nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . \\nhe is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . \\nhis bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability . \\nwashington provides much of the film\\'s intensity and emotional power . \\nin one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army . \\nwhen he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . \\nit makes your blood boil . \\nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington\\'s cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \\nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn\\'t deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \\nfreeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \\nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \\nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \\ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman\\'s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . \\nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw\\'s close childhood friends . \\nsearles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him \" snow flake . \" \\nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . \\nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \\nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . \\nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . \\nthey are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . \\nto make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \\neventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \\nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \\nbroderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . \\nunfortunately , however , broderick\\'s uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \\nin an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \\nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \\nthe film places too much weight on broderick\\'s character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \\nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . \\nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \\nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \\nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \\nto the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it\\'s just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \\nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \\nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \\nin one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \\neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \\na couple of the movie\\'s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \\nthe regiment\\'s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \\nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north\\'s victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \\n', b'weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg\\'s reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . \\nthere ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . \\nspielberg\\'s greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . \\nbut for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . \\nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . \\n_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a \" pr mission \" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . \\nryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . \\nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . \\nthere\\'s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . \\nthe equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . \\nthe opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . \\nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg\\'s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . \\nthe technical side of the film is peerless , as always . \\nthe camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . \\nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . \\nyet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . \\nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . \\nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . \\nfor example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . \\nhere and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there\\'s an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . \\nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . \\nthere are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . \\nthe relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . \\nultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . \\nrather than saying _saving private ryan_ is \" realistic , \" it would be better to describe it as \" having realistic moments . \" \\nanother aspect of the \" hollywoodization \" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . \\nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell\\'s superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . \\n \" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? \" \\nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight . \\nrendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as \" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? \" \\nor some variant thereof . \\nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the \" f \" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . \\nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an \" r \" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . \\nhowever , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . \\nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . \\nhe cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . \\nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler\\'s list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler\\'s monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller\\'s last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . \\nthat particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . \\nnowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . \\nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows . \\n . \\n', b'in 1989 , director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama , \" glory , \" but since then , he has made continuous disappointments , to me at least , with 1994\\'s \" legends of the fall , \" and 1996\\'s \" courage under fire . \" \\nthose two films weren\\'t bad , just not very good , but with zwick\\'s latest film , \" the siege , \" he has finally made one . \\n \" the siege , \" is a modern-day action-thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city . \\ninvestigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) and frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) , who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it . \\nlater , a bomb goes off in a broadway theater , killing even more . \\nthey soon meet cia operative elise kraft ( annette bening ) , who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist . \\nthere are some movies that simply don\\'t need to be made , and , \" the siege \" may very well be one of them . \\noh , sure , zwick thinks he is making a \" meaningful \" action film , since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism , but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than , say , \" die hard , \" which also starred bruce willis . \\nthis time , willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u . s . army , who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax . \\nwhatever points , \" the siege , \" earnestly tried to make , were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen , or maybe , zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place . \\nthe role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical , just as women were in the recent , \" john caprenter\\'s vampires , \" by placing them all in the category of \" bad guys . \" \\n \" the siege , \" contains three fine actors---washington , bening , and shalhoub---but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development . \\nbening has slightly more to do , and has an intriguing character to work with , while shalhoub pretty much steals the show , even though , again , he has no real character . \\nby the climax of , \" the siege , \" with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so-called \" message \" of the story , i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to , \" on deadly ground , \" in which steven seagal gave a 10-minute speech at the end about preserving the environment . \\n \" the siege \" is constantly heavy-handed , not entertaining or insightful , and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay . \\n', b\"aliens ! ! well , that is what this movie is about . \\ncomputer generated aliens . \\nok , the movie is not just about computer generated aliens . \\nit's about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib . \\nif one wasn't green and running around the other would not exist as it's known . \\nthe computer graphics in this movie are spectacular , they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits . \\nsince seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien , he simply has to be . \\nwell , in all seriousness the aliens created here are not only of the monster variety but are also of the soft , squishy and cuddly kind . \\njust adds something of a lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark . \\nalong with aliens comes the humor and in a pretty decent way . \\nj , well soon to be j , a smart ass cop ( played by will smith ) runs down what he thinks is a would-be villain and gets some attention from the mib and k in particular . \\nk aims to recruit our poor j , but that is not the whole point of this movie . \\nthe main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as a home or a refuge . \\nthat's also the main point of this movie : protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy . \\nsome of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty . \\ncolor commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch . \\nthe dialogue is witty to say the least . \\nthis wittiness lets the movie flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie . \\ntommy lee jones ( as k ) and will smith ( as j ) provide both the action and the comedy beautifully . \\nthe characters they play don't seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them . \\ni would have to say that k is more amusing than j , but what's one without the other . \\nboth roles complemented each other very well and the script seemed to be written for these two actors . \\nthe story also goes deep enough to provide a proper background so the audience is not totally clueless . \\naltogether good performances were put in by all the cast and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary special effects to create a good movie . \\na movie well worth seeing if you are up for some lighthearted and witty humor . \\nas most movies have their good things they also have their bad things . \\nthe character development in this movie was not all that grand because it didn't need to be . \\nbut if there was more character development and if there was some development of the alien characters that might have added quite considerable to the movie . \\nespecially the evil alien , he did need some work . \\nthough this could have been worked on , the movie was what it proposed to be a rather shallow and witty comedy . \\nthat was achieved rather well , with some interesting commentary and observations . \\na movie worth a view , but keep in mind what the movie is and if you are not fond of will smith's form of humor then i wouldn't go . \\noriginally written after original release . \\ntotally rewritten december 26 , 1997 \\n\", b'mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . \\nhis entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . \\njoe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . \\nduring this scene , i turned to my friend and said , \" wow . \\nthat\\'s some ape . \" \\njoe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . \\nhe runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . \\nhe picks things up and stares at them pensively . \\nhe breaks things on accident , because he\\'s just too big to avoid clumsiness . \\njoe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . \\nas a character , he doesn\\'t quite register . \\nand the story he\\'s been put in is as limp as they come . \\nthe words \" family entertainment \" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . \\nthe picture is a remake of the 1949 film . \\nit\\'s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . \\nthe main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . \\nas a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . \\nspecifically , she\\'s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . \\nsoon , zoologist gregg o\\'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill\\'s mother . \\nso , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . \\nin addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . \\nand , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill\\'s mother . \\njill , of course , doesn\\'t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . \\nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . \\nthe movie isn\\'t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . \\nbut the story is really dumb , there aren\\'t any characters , and the film isn\\'t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . \\nthe movie also has bad dialogue . \\nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it\\'s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like \" joe isn\\'t happy ! \" \\nand \" joe isn\\'t safe here ! \" \\n \" we need to get joe out of here ! \" \\n \" joe is way too big for that cage ! \" \\ni don\\'t know if these phrases are word for word , but they\\'re close . \\nas i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . \\npaxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . \\nsadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . \\nthere are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . \\nit\\'s certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . \\nbut adults in the audience aren\\'t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . \\na big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . \\nnobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . \\n', b'the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films . \\none was _gattaca_ . \\nthe other was _the thirteenth floor_ . \\njust as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_ . \\nhowever , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_ . \\na cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered . \\nhis associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery . \\nalong the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture . \\n_the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise . \\nthe result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view . \\nfirst , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline . \\nsecond and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel . \\nno wonder it fell through the cracks . \\ndone in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels . \\nmany audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment . \\ni recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie . \\ndespite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller . \\nin that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever . \\nthe moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging . \\nin its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane\\'s husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one . \\nalthough there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep-seated character flaw . \\nin fact , hannon fuller\\'s activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane\\'s husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters . \\nthis is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil . \\nthe tragedy is not in their stars , but in themselves . \\nthe major actors , all of whom are required to play two or even three roles , perform extremely well . \\nbierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ , is outstanding . \\nd\\'onofrio as whitney , who plays a pivotal role in support , also turns in a good performance . \\nthe lovely gretchen mol , whose elegance , integrity , and determination suggest bergman in _casablanca_ , does a wonderful job . \\nher voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times . \\nthis could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script . \\nsome minor flaws , hairline cracks in fine porcelain , appear in places . \\nthere are one or two instances of jerky editing . \\nthe script takes the edge off the film\\'s climaxes . \\nthe atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times ( yet , there is a clue there too ) . \\none wonders if even after two decades , _blade runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci-fi films . \\none can see a group of suits in their suite , waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in _amadeus_ : \" make it more like_blade runner_ , you know , dark and rainy . \" \\n_the thirteen floor_ is that rare exception among hollywood movies : a , rich , emotionally satisfying , intelligent sci-fi movie . \\nand yet , ultimately , it proves the suits right . \\nfor when good sci-fi is made , where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it ? \\nif we don\\'t support great sf , who will ? \\n', b'robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . \\nmel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . \\nunfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . \\nit is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . \\nthe plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . \\nthis is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . \\nmel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . \\nthe movie\\'s scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . \\ncary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . \\nhe escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . \\nhe also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil \" sheriff of rottingham \" . \\na good adventure plot that is sadly unused . \\nelwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . \\nneither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren\\'t funny , nor believable . \\nperhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . \\nthis particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . \\nmuch of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . \\nchuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from \" rent-a-wreck \" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . \\nscenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . \\nperhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . \\nthe basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . \\nmel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . \\nthe movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . \\nthe addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . \\nthe only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . \\nhe is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . \\nif you can\\'t , don\\'t even bother watching this miserable film . \\n', b'these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . \\n1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . \\nfew years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . \\nhowever , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . \\none of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon\\'s loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas . \\nbeing made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement . \\ntwo of them , following the murder of luger\\'s ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . \\nthe authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines . \\nthe plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film \" borrows \" its female lead from basic instinct ) . \\nthe best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers . \\nthe rest simply doesn\\'t work . \\nonly those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . \\nothers would probably wince at the lameness of humour . \\nsome would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . \\nbut , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort . \\nthe film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones . \\nthe authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel . \\n', b'numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . \\nsoldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . \\nthe problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . \\nbesides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . \\nthe fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . \\nrussell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . \\nbesides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . \\nthis movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . \\nalthough this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable . \\n', b'working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . \\ndespite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) . \\nthe problem is , of course , that there aren\\'t many good roles available for black women . \\ntake away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve\\'s bayou , and all that\\'s left is a chance to be someone\\'s girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim . \\nas a result , for pinkett smith\\'s first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . \\nactually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s . \\nmayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is . \\nthe film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith\\'s woo and tommy davidson\\'s tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren\\'t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags . \\nunfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q . \\nthe situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of \" free lobotomy \" lab experiment . \\nwoo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . \\nher latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . \\nnow , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she\\'s about to meet mr . right , and that he\\'ll be a virgo . \\nlater that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo . \\nit\\'s not love at first sight , however . \\nthings get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a \" quiet \" dinner . \\nin the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad \" white \" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it\\'s only fair that we get a \" black \" effort of the same low caliber . \\nas in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . \\nthe question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ? \\nin a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is . \\nin woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project . \\nfor those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there\\'s a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . \\nsadly , that\\'s one of the film\\'s most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . \\ndespite exuding charm from every pore , there\\'s little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson\\'s script . \\nsince it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops . \\n', b'a cinematic version of one of john irving\\'s novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of \" simon birch , \" the treatment is merely \" suggested by , \" rather than strictly based on , the book . \\nsuggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed \" the world according to garp , \" sold the rights to his novel \" a prayer for owen meany \" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn\\'t grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names . \\nthat\\'s an odd decision--irving claims it\\'s to protect both himself and the novel--but it\\'s one that doesn\\'t unduly harm the finished product . \\nirving\\'s books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters . \\n \" a prayer for owen meany \" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , \" like strangled mice . \" \\nsimon believes himself to be \" god\\'s instrument , \" placed on this earth to somehow effect god\\'s plan . \\nsimon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally . \\nsmith\\'s debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for \" simon birch \" ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith\\'s acting abilities are limited at best . \\nanother drawback is that in the book , simon\\'s condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail . \\nwatching \" simon birch , \" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended . \\nsimon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith\\'s rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he\\'s forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film\\'s director and screenwriter . \\nfortunately , simon birch isn\\'t the real star of the film that bears his name . \\nsimon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny . \\nfirst and foremost is joseph mazzello ( \" jurassic park \" ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon\\'s best friend , joe . \\nmazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent . \\nashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe\\'s single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben . \\ndavid strathairn and jan hooks play the town\\'s reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others . \\nthere\\'s even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . . \\nwell , that would be telling . \\nperhaps \" suggested by \" the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since \" simon birch \" only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon\\'s extraordinary life . \\nthe film also changes the book\\'s ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon\\'s lot . \\nthe flavor of irving\\'s original novel remains , however--the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there . \\n', b\"starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . \\nnot that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . \\nand in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence . \\nsure . \\nwilliam baldwin isn't a bad actor . \\nunfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie . \\ni'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good . \\nif it was the latter , it worked . \\ncindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . \\nwhich is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement . \\nalthough to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . \\nso right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? \\nwell , i'm glad you asked that question . \\ncindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . \\nwhy woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? \\nby the end of the movie you won't care . \\nthe story is so contrived it isn't funny . \\nanyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . \\nwho's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) . \\nthe point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . \\nthe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . \\nif i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears . \\nas for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . \\nunfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . \\nthis movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . \\nit's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . \\nunless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you . \\n\", b'pulp fiction , quentin tarantino\\'s anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time . \\nin all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it . \\nas if reservoir dogs wasn\\'t perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way . \\nevery major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor . \\nto begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) . \\nthese two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect . \\ntravolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role . \\nif these two characters were not enough , there\\'s the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the \" problem solver \" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) . \\nthese are just the major characters . \\nsmaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men \" behind \" ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film . \\nthe film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other . \\nthe film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups . \\nthe two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead . \\nafter this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle . \\nutilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants . \\nthe two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace . \\nafter basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase . \\nthis is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357 \\n \" hand cannon \" , shooting at the two gangsters . \\nhe somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention . \\nthis is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue . \\nthe film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades . \\nbutch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune . \\nvincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus\\' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town . \\nvincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage . \\nafter their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent\\'s high-priced heroin , dubbed a \" monster \" by lance . \\neach story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur . \\neventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules . \\npulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time . \\nalong with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you . \\nand with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering . \\nsurely , quentin tarantino\\'s fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon . \\n', b'its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated , yet trys a bit too hard . \\nwith the voices of woody allen , gene hackman , jennifer lopez , sylvester stallone , and sharon stone , this computer-animated yak-fest ( think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising ) is one for the ant-eaters . \\nthe main story is the independence of a worker named z ( allen ) . \\nhe wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony . \\nwhen he finds out about ``insectopia , \" a mythical place where all insects can run free , z , along with his colony\\'s princess ( stone ) , journey out into the world to find a meaning for life . \\nabout 15 minutes into the picture , i began to wonder what the point of the film was . \\nhalfway through , i still didn\\'t have an answer . \\nby the end credits , i just gave up and ran out . \\nantz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs . \\nallen is nonchalant , while i would have guessed , if i hadn\\'t seen her in the mighty and basic instinct , stone can\\'t act , even in a cartoon . \\nthis film is one for the bugs : unfunny and extremely dull . \\nhey , a bug\\'s life may have a good time doing antz in . \\n', b'i was anxious to see this for a long time . \\na friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell , and he wanted to prove that she\\'s as hot as he thinks he is . \\nhe proved it for me all right , but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that . \\nscream treads on familar ground , horror movie with , as star neve campbell puts it , \" some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can\\'t act who\\'s always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door . \" \\nit\\'s very familar , your typical horror film . \\nso why , you may ask after watching it , does it seem so new and original ? \\nbecause it treats itself as if it hasn\\'t been done before , and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old , familar tired stuff . \\nthis raises another question : how does it do this ? \\nsimple : the characters . \\nthey\\'re not your typical stupid horror film victims who don\\'t know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette . \\nthey are horror fans , they know how stuff happens in a horror movie , they know what to do and what not to do , and that makes it scary , and even funny at certain times . \\nyou can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker ( drew barrymore ) is making popcorn , getting ready to watch a video , and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that , if she gets it wrong , will get her and her boyfriend killed . \\nshe knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions , she just can\\'t answer his final question , \" what door am i at ? \" \\nand that gets her killed . \\nthat scene works because in a normal horror film , half the things that happen in that scene would never happen . \\nthe plot is typical horror stuff : sidney prescott ( an impressive neve campbell ) , an attractive young high school student who\\'s mother was killed a year ago tommorrow , is being stalked by a killer who\\'s previously murdered one of her classmates ( casey , naturally ) , and everybody in this small , california town is a suspect , including sidney\\'s boyfriend , billy loomis . \\nbut as i said before , these people know how horror movies work , and that\\'s what makes it so appealing . \\nthat and the references to horror movies , like when casey says , \" the first ( nightmare on elm street ) was scary , but the rest sucked . \" \\nwhich is obviously director wes craven ( who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend ) patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others , and when tatum , sidney\\'s friend , mentions the director , wes carpenter , which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven , but also director john carpenter . \\nthe cast is well chosen , neve campbell pulls off a good heroine ( and unlike most horror film heroines , she * can * act ) , drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film , and david arquette is impressive . \\nalso good ( and funny ) in his role is henry winkler ( \" the fonz \" ) as the school principal . \\ni took half a point off for the unnecessary ( albeit limited ) appearance by friends\\' courteney cox as reporter , gail edwards , sidney\\'s rival because she covered her mother\\'s disappearance . \\ni hate that show , i hate those actors . \\nthey\\'re untalented , overexposed , and overpaid , imho , and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough , but i suppose he isn\\'t . \\n', b'jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance . \\nfor the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film . \\ndaryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes . \\nthe parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) . \\nhe even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes . \\nhowever zero\\'s observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society . \\nhe could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) . \\narlo is not happy with his job . \\nhe is thrilled to be around zero\\'s brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer . \\nand they\\'re even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend\\'s boss means more to arlo than her . \\nthis is the situation when a new case comes knocking . \\ngregory stark ( ryan o\\'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys . \\nit seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence . \\nnow , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end . \\nto solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell . \\nhowever , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and \\nthis time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme . \\nfor the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic . \\nzero effect is weakest in its obviously \" wacky \" scenes depicting daryl zero\\'s odd behavior . \\nsuch scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character . \\nhowever , there\\'s a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . \\nthat\\'s not to say that there\\'s not a place for humor in this film . \\nin fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller\\'s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer . \\nhowever , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren\\'t funny enough to stand on their own . \\nonce the investigation is underway , however , zero\\'s brilliance really begins to shine . \\nhis lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock\\'s own . \\nas the mystery begins to unfold , zero\\'s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer . \\nzero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well . \\nzero\\'s relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes . \\nhowever , we are always kept distant from gloria\\'s character . \\nshe\\'s given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking . \\nperhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero\\'s zone of detachment . \\nbut , on the whole , it is frustrating . \\nbill pullman , when he\\'s not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero . \\nthere\\'s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well . \\nand , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called \" zero \" seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name . \\nalthough zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise . \\n', b'while screen adaptations of john irving\\'s novels have been disappointingly uneven , the films have all shared one particular strength : key casting . \\nwho can forget john lithgow as roberta muldoon , the transsexual quarterback of \" the world according to garp , \" or nastassja kinski as susie the bear in \" the hotel new hampshire \" ? \\na lot of good casting decisions have gone into the making of \" the cider house rules , \" an adaptation of irving\\'s poetic 1994 novel about a restless young man called homer wells . \\namong those sound judgments was the decision to have the splendid tobey maguire assume the pivotal role ; the decision to cast michael caine as his mentor and father figure , dr . wilbur larch , the ether-addicted head obstetrician of the st . cloud\\'s orphanage , maine ; and the decision to offer jane alexander and kathy baker supporting roles as his head nurses . \\nthen there are the brethren who populate the apple orchard where homer wells finds himself shortly after leaving st . cloud\\'s , including delroy lindo , oscar ? -worthy as the foreman of the migrant work detail that drifts up and down the coast as the seasons take them . \\nthere\\'s kate nelligan as the matriarch of the cider house , and charlize theron as candy , the lovely , lonely wife of a wwii bomber pilot ( paul rudd ) sent away on a mission overseas leaving candy to set lobster traps with homer wells , a man who\\'s never seen the ocean before let alone a lobster . \\nam i forgetting anyone ? \\nyes . \\nkieran culkin and paz de la huerta as dissolute orphanage residents who make you sit up and take notice every time they\\'re on the screen . \\nbut with \" the cider house rules , \" the good people decisions don\\'t end with the cast . \\nirving has written his own screenplay in order to get it right this time ( last year\\'s \" simon birch , \" loosely based on his \" a prayer for owen meaney , \" was a big-screen example of irving handled sub-standardly ) ; the author appears fleetingly as a stationmaster here . \\nrachel portman , a composer of such sweet and lyrical tenderness , provides a score that\\'s absolutely right for the project--sweet , lyrical , and tender . \\nthere\\'s impressive new england photography by oliver stapleton too . \\nlast but by no means least is \" my life as a dog \" director lasse hallstr ? m , who shows enormous skill in pulling this collective together and helping bring irving\\'s marvelously touching story to life . \\nfor the many beloved who pass away in \" the cider house rules , \" it\\'s an extraordinarily life-affirming story . \\nand now , thanks to these talented individuals , it\\'s an extraordinarily life-affirming film . \\n', b'a follow-up to disney\\'s live-action \" 101 dalmatians \" that\\'s better , more entertaining than the first ? \\njust as unlikely . \\nwith \" 102 dalmatians , \" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . \\n1996\\'s \" 101 dalmatians \" certainly wasn\\'t the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . \\nin addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . \\nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close\\'s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . \\nbut that\\'s only half the problem with kevin lima\\'s laborious film . \\nwhat makes \" 102 dalmatians \" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he\\'s a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic \" heroes \" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . \\ngruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can\\'t even aspire to that . \\nthe dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close\\'s split ends are more animated . \\nbad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro\\'s in \" men of honor . \" \\njean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu\\'s over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . \\nfrance\\'s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in \" 102 dalmatians \" the producers milk that realization for all it\\'s worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as \" poopies , \" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . \\nthe finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . \\nthat done , it\\'s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . \\nthe dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that\\'s pretty much all they are . \\nthere\\'s always the feeling that there\\'s a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . \\nsavvy holiday goers should skip \" 102 dalmatians \" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . \\nit\\'s one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . \\n', b\"here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject , is there a god ? \\ndone well , it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children's cinema . \\nunfortunately , it isn't . \\nwith jumbled messages , and an unclear audience , wide awake was better left asleep . \\nfifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis . \\nhis beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest . \\nhe wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen . \\nthis religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths . \\nat his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own . \\nmeanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life . \\nhe has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey . \\nit is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be . \\non its surface , it appears to be a kid's film . \\nhowever , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today's instant-gratification kids . \\nand while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer . \\nif there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie . \\nthe actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos . \\nthe nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here . \\nthe film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather . \\nthey show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . \\nmaybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua's last year with his grandpa . \\nit certainly would have been more entertaining . \\nwide awake can best be described as a failed experiment . \\nit starts out with noble aspirations , but never delivers on its promise . \\nparents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions . . . that is if their kids aren't bored to death first . \\n\", b'the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . \\ndoubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor\\'s first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . \\nit was his first truly dramatic role since 1989\\'s dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive . \\nhis next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster . \\nand so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams . \\nwilliams is the title character , hunter \" patch \" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting . \\nwe\\'re introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies . \\nit\\'s at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people . \\nhe removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia\\'s medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade . \\nhis attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch\\'s appearance before the state medical board . \\nthe characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense . \\nalthough the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there\\'s little story to be told outside of patch\\'s skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters . \\nat medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch\\'s zest for humanity . \\nthe two instantly become the best of friends , and it\\'s easy to see why . \\nmonica potter plays patch\\'s love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school . \\nfor some reason he\\'s attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view . \\nthe script -- based on hunter adams\\' own story -- works well this way . \\nthe rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid . \\ndirector tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch\\'s life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams\\' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring . \\npatch adams\\' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there\\'s little feeling of continuity or the passage of time . \\nnevertheless , it\\'s an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season . \\nit succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn\\'t try in the first place . \\nby and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it\\'s entertainment for the entire family . \\n', b'it\\'s a good thing most animated sci-fi movies come from japan , because \" titan a . e . \" is proof that hollywood doesn\\'t have a clue how to do it . \\ni don\\'t know what this film is supposed to be about . \\nfrom what i can tell it\\'s about a young man named kale who\\'s one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re-generating what is left of the human race . \\nthat\\'s a fine premise for an action-packed sci-fi animated movie , but there\\'s no payoff . \\nthe story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil \" dredge \" aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason . \\nso in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights , fistfights , blaster fights and more double-crosses than you can shake a stick at . \\nthere\\'s so much pointless sci-fi banter it\\'s too much to take . \\nthe galaxy here is a total rip-off of the \" star wars \" universe the creators don\\'t bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing , the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring . \\ndespite the fantastic animation and special effects , it\\'s just not an interesting movie . \\n', b\"the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made . \\na captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget . \\nin this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives . \\nthe first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together . \\nmichael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group . \\nafter a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works . \\nthree of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married . \\nafter the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times . \\nthis sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war . \\nthe wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act . \\nthe outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future . \\nthe second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong . \\nthe men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river . \\nthis prison , run by the v . c . , \\ninitiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other . \\nsteven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate . \\nmichael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun . \\npersonally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes . \\nthe men are eventually able to escape , but are separated . \\nmichael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u . s . army hospital . \\nmichael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero . \\nhe wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him . \\nhe assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam . \\nthe third act concentrates more on walken's character , who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is , again , russian roulette . \\nonly in this game , you play for money . \\nmichael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him . \\nthe two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games , but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home . \\na very emotional , and , for many , a very disturbing movie , the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed . \\nthe greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors , and cimino's directing , which is considered to be at his all-time best in this film , is equally dazzling . \\ndo not miss this film , it will captivate and astound you . \\n\", b'in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural \" rush hour \" - to the tune of about $250 million . \\nyou don\\'t mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in \" rush hour 2 . \" \\nthe combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in \" rush hour \" that played well to audiences around the world . \\nthe formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . \\ni\\'m never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . \\nsurprisingly , \" rush hour 2 \" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . \\nthe script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start . \\nterrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . \\nconcurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . \\ninstead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . \\nthe makers of \" rush hour 2 \" are working at a distinct advantage over the original . \\nwe , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . \\nthat chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . \\nlittle time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in \" rush hour . \" \\nfirst and foremost to me , in \" rh2 , \" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan\\'s artistry in fight choreography . \\nthe 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint . \\nchan\\'s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . \\nhis moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . \\nlike harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . \\nchris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . \\nwhen he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . \\nwhen lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . \\nthe comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . \\nthe combo of chan\\'s flying feet and fists with tucker\\'s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the \" lethal weapon \" films . \\nthe supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . \\njohn lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . \\nlone doesn\\'t chew scenery or make pronouncements to \" get lee and carter , \" but gives the chief bad guy elegance . \\nzhang zi-yi ( \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon \" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky\\'s taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . \\n ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . ) \\nroselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn\\'t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch . \\ndirector ratner and the original \" rush hour \" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera . \\ncinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives \" rh2 \" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . \\nproduction design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . \\nthe rest of the techs are of the same high quality . \\ni\\'m surprised to even say that \" rush hour 2 \" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . \\nit takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer . \\ni give it a b . \\n', b'plot : based on the wildly popular \" jerry springer \" tv show , this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program . \\none posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the \" i slept with my stepfather \" segment , and the other is based on some fly-girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted \" dog \" boyfriend . \\ncritique : the truth is that if i didn\\'t have a day job , i would probably watch the real \" jerry springer \" show every day . \\ni find it quite entertaining , despite its complete lack of redeeming value . \\nhaving said that , the show itself is outrageous , funny , and always filled with goofy surprises , as opposed to this film which features no laughs ( is this a comedy or a drama ? ) , uninteresting and completely unbelievable one-dimensional stereotypes , and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way . \\ni never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer , but this film is an absolute yawn-fest , despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs , lesbians , t&a and tv violence ( who would\\'ve guessed that ? ) . \\ni wish they would have either a ) made this movie much , much funnier , or b ) turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment . \\nunfortunately , it doesn\\'t seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real \" jerry springer \" reruns to complete his script , leaving us with a boring film , featuring no laughs , one-dimensional characters , and no fun whatsoever . \\nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati , ohio . \\nfor this film , he won the 1999 razzie award for worst new star , tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film : burn hollywood burn . \\n', b'meet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 ) \\nstarring brad pitt , anthony hopkins , claire forlani \\nin \" meet joe black \" , brad pitt plays death . \\nthat\\'s all that really needs to be said , but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description . \\ndeath decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it\\'s like to be human . \\ndeath assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues . \\nfor one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani . \\nobviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ? \\nbesides eternal damnation , of course . \\nthere is also a sub-plot about forlani\\'s ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company . \\n \" meet joe black \" runs just under three hours . \\ni\\'ve always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics . \\n \" meet joe black \" is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be . \\nevery single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long . \\nand the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should . \\na severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is . \\npitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death . \\ni believed his performance , and i could see why forlani\\'s character would fall in love with him . \\ni have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that\\'s been around for all time wouldn\\'t know what peanut butter was . \\nthat has nothing to do with pitt\\'s performance , of course , but it is a little distracting . \\nhopkins gives his usual excellent performance . \\nhe\\'s able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner . \\nand in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good . \\nshe has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her . \\nso , \" meet joe black \" is a good movie hampered by it\\'s ridiculous running time . \\nhad the film been cut by an hour or so , i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review . \\n', b'the crown jewel of 1970\\'s irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all-star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship . \\nthe story begins on the u . s . s . \\nposeidon\\'s big new year\\'s cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive . \\nlet\\'s see , there\\'s the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to \" pray to that part of god within yourself . \" \\nthere\\'s the ex-cop ( borgnine ) who busted a hooker ( stella stevens ) six times -- then married her . \\nthere\\'s the hippie singer ( \" there\\'s got to be a morning after . . . \" ) who turns to the company of a lonely man ( red buttons ) once her brother is killed . \\nand to round out the group : the elderly couple ( jack albertson and shelley winters ) who live aboard the ship , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall . \\nwe get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure , before straight- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship . \\neveryone\\'s in the giant ballroom at the time , shortly past midnight of the new year , when the ship turns first on its side , then completely upside down . \\nthe second- in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives , but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship . \\nin this case , because the ship is overturned , the top is the bottom . \\nor is the bottom the top ? \\neither way , we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- christmas trees . \\nthus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors , through burning rooms , etc . while the ship slowly fills with water behind them . \\nit\\'s a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting . \\nthe poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at , with all the melodrama that comes in-between the non-thrilling action scenes . \\nthe one note in borgnine\\'s one-note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love ( although since there isn\\'t a sex scene , we never find out if his buttons really are red ) and albertson and winters wonder if they\\'ll live to see their grandson\\'s birth . \\nshelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end , where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along . \\nwinters , who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie ( stevens even not-so- affectionately calls her \" fatass \" in one scene ) , finally finds her purpose . \\n \" i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen , \" she brags , and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years , she\\'s swimming through the water , her skirt billowing up around her hips , showing off her cellulite ( or do you call it shellulite ? ) \\nridden thighs . \\nit\\'s not so much funny as innately disgusting , which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole . \\n', b'there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened . \\nand , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why . \\nthis movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago . \\nfire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god\\'s country , somewhere in eastern kentucky . \\nit\\'s beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) . \\nit turns out that he\\'s filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit . \\nseagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa . \\nno . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa . \\nit\\'s the environmental protection agency . \\ni had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers ! \\ntaggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice . \\nwritten by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks . \\nbut the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in . \\nseagal\\'s idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket . \\nbut to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people\\'s porches for free . \\nthat\\'s another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches . \\nslow and plodding , this project is a total mess . \\nthe sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige . \\nhere , his bravado basically turns into bullyness . \\ntownsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued . \\nfight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever . \\nand his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes . \\nthe most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment . \\nbut the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal . \\nkristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away . \\nseagal gallantly replies : \" i\\'ll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . \" \\ni was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background . \\nthis is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal\\'s righteousness and narcissistic arrogance . \\nseagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) . \\nhowever , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this . \\nstill , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity . \\n', b'one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , \" se7en \" is just a few steps away from brilliance . \\nhowever , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . \\nthe film received mixed reviews upon release , but there\\'s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . \\nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent . \\nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable . \\nthis piece of work is 100% intensity . \\nit\\'s uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling . \\n \" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . \" \\nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . \\nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . \\nthis is the guy who directed the ominous \" alien 3 \" . \\n \" se7en \" is even more ominous because the threat is real . \\nit\\'s human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . \\nthat is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . \\nafter the most bizarre opening credits i\\'ve ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . \\nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . \\nbrad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . \\nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills\\' wife ) . \\nhowever , none of them stands out above the material . \\nno disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . \\nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that\\'s seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . \\nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in \" paradise lost \" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . \\nincidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . \\nit\\'s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won\\'t give that away . \\nas i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . \\nanyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the \" sinners \" suffer for it . \\nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . \\nthey learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . \\nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . \\nif they didn\\'t , it would be one short movie ! \\nthe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story . \\nwe see a lot of blood , but it\\'s not especially violent . \\nthe suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in \" pulp fiction \" . \\n \" se7en \" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death . \\nstill , if you tend to get queasy , don\\'t eat food during this film . \\nkevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he\\'s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings . \\nlike many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself . \\nspacey doesn\\'t appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn\\'t receive billing in the opening credits . \\nhowever , it\\'s his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination . \\na great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not . \\nthis character is so well written that it\\'s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone . \\nno serial killer has ever been so creative . \\n \" se7en \" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it\\'s often a little too depressing . \\nwhat it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters . \\nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive . \\nfincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film . \\nfortunately , we don\\'t find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) . \\nit\\'s better to imagine what paths they will follow . \\nthis is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget . \\nit\\'s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren\\'t going to cure themselves . \\n \" se7en \" raises some tough questions and it\\'s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves . \\nuseless trivia--co-stars in 1995\\'s \" se7en \" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in \" 12 monkeys \" , spacey in \" the usual suspects \" ( for which he won ) . \\n', b'america loves convenience . \\nafter all , we\\'re the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control . \\nyet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far . \\nghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin\\' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve \" demolition \" williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home . \\nwhen she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed \" the commander , \" \" the rookies , \" and the guy with the cool accent discover the town\\'s residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents\\' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches . \\nfilled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences . \\nthe only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story . \\nripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose . \\nattempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced . \\nmost of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube . \\nwith a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to \" me and my brother when we was kids . \" \\napparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment . \\nbut , even in the film\\'s darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite . \\nyes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt . \\nand as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand . \\ncharacters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ? \\nas long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed . \\neventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson . \\nwhat better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can\\'t handle . \\nexplosions are fun . \\nand even if the nukes don\\'t get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will . \\nin the end this film defines itself when our cop\\'s tribunal pronounces , \" is that all you have to tell us ? \" \\nfor , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story . \\n', b' \" the red violin \" is a cold , sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached . \\nit\\'s a movie that seems almost clinical , as it traces the 300-plus-years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title . \\nopening in the 17th century , the story shows how violin-maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son . \\nbut when tragedy strikes , the violin becomes the personification of its maker\\'s grief . \\nfrom there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery . \\nagain , tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph . \\nwe follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao\\'s communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz ( samuel l . jackson ) , who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity . \\nthe violin becomes morritz\\'s obsession , just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it . \\nmorritz , however , is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator\\'s intention . \\n \" the red violin \" could have been a touching , inspirational story , as soaring as a beethoven symphony . \\nhowever director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer . \\nhere is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact . \\ngirard , for some unknown reason , uses mostly master shots , keeping his camera - and thus us - at a distance . \\nwe get no feel for the miracle that is the violin . \\nit\\'s resonance , its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression . \\nnor are any of the performances memorable . \\nit\\'s as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin . \\n \" the red violin \" promises much , but delivers little . \\nit is dull at times , a bit pretentious and a might murky . \\nthe movie\\'s music soars over its story and performers . \\nand that is its only saving grace . \\n', b'the premise of the new james wong film , final destination , is that alex browning , the protagonist , prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane , thereby cheating fate . \\nhowever , fate is not so easily bested , and alex\\'s friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances . \\nessentially , this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher . \\nunfortunately , this is practically the only clever thing about the film . \\nas far as teen horror flicks go , final destination is better than many . \\nthere is enough shocking death , graphic gore , and requisite black humor to provide the essential \" roller coaster \" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick . \\nunfortunately , this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre . \\nthe relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death . \\nthe scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed . \\nif you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date , this film might do the trick . \\nother than that , wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable . \\n', b\"the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . \\nin this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . \\nthis movie closely resembles a james bond flick . \\nit has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . \\nkilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . \\nthe movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . \\nas a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . \\nthat is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . \\nhe refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . \\nthis leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . \\nkilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . \\nduring a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . \\nonce his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . \\nwhen he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . \\ndr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . \\nthis new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . \\nthe only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . \\nthis presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . \\ntretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . \\none of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . \\nthey are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . \\nkilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue's character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . \\nwhen the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer's character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer's alter-ego , a traveling artist . \\nyet , he must reach his goal of $50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . \\nshue's character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . \\nwhen she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . \\nthe saint is very action-packed , with few slow points . \\nthe sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . \\nalong the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . \\nthese moments are almost always thanks to kilmer's extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . \\nall in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non-stop action . \\n\", b\"the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's . \\nmore practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film . \\nalongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation . \\nin his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's . \\n ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) \\nthis story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco . \\nthe film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier . \\nthey hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . \\nto reveal any more of the story would be unfair . \\nsuffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english . \\nbava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento . \\nher character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul . \\nthe music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences . \\nand there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair . \\nyet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal . \\nlamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap . \\nscholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential . \\n\", b'for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects . \\nbut while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark . \\nthe center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him . \\nhe spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars . \\nthen , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter . \\nraymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie\\'s brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing . \\nraymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck . \\nbut these are the least of billy\\'s problems . \\nbilly is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn\\'t seem that he\\'ll last much longer . \\nbilly and valerie\\'s mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond\\'s nemesis . \\nshe disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it . \\nshe merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments . \\nif this description seems bleak , i haven\\'t told the half of it . \\nthis is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it\\'s downright depressing . \\nwhile at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it\\'s not quite worth it . \\nthere are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose . \\ntake for example the extended sequence where one of billy\\'s scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy . \\nthe film is filled with these \" character moments \" that never really achieve anything . \\ngranted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us . \\nthe actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles . \\nthe good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into . \\nthe bad thing about an actor turned director is that there\\'s no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices . \\na good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience . \\noldman got it about half right . \\n', b' \" being john malkovich \" is the type of film we need to see more . \\ntoday\\'s films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas , or those that have similar themes . \\nmalkovich falls under none of these categories , and it\\'s quite refreshing to see that occur . \\nthis strangely provoking story , is actually somewhat understandable . \\njohn cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time . \\nhis wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore , which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment . \\nwhen cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job , he finds an ad for a filing clerk . \\nwhen he reaches the building , he arrives at a 7 1/2 floor . \\nit\\'s there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time . \\nmeanwhile , cusack meets a business partner ( catherine keener ) , in which he falls madly in love with her . \\nthe only problem is , she has no interest in him what so ever . \\nthe whole portal thing , isn\\'t just a toy , in fact , it becomes cusack\\'s dream . \\nbeing inside malkovich\\'s mind , gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich , like a puppet , and to fulfill his fantasies . \\ni don\\'t want to give away too much , but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery . \\nin my opinion , this idea is absolutely brilliant . \\nit\\'s really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you . \\nit makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue . \\neven if the script is super sharp , i can\\'t help but find the ending displeasing . \\nit could have lead up to something more , or at least an amusing conclusion . \\nit tried to explain a mythology about the portals , that made it seem rushed . \\nother than that , i had a very enjoyable time . \\nthe acting was quite delightful as well . \\njohn cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability , and he does it well . \\nhe\\'s by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity , but i\\'m hoping that will change . \\ncameron diaz was her usual charming self , although i felt that part was wrong for her , but she pulled it off . \\njohn malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice . \\nwho else\\'s mind would be better to explore ? \\nthe director , spike jonze , who appeared in last month\\'s three kings really catches my attention with this project . \\ni knew he was bizzare , but not to this extreme . \\nhe too is likely too receive media attention . \\n \" being john malkovich \" isn\\'t an excellent film , but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite . \\nwhat\\'s even better is the film\\'s puzzling message . . . am \\ni nick lyons ? \\n', b\"good films are hard to find these days . \\ngreat films are beyond rare . \\nproof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . \\na taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . \\nconsider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . \\ni haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway . \\nbut enough with the gossip , let's get to the review . \\nthe film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . \\nupon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . \\nthe only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . \\nwith no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . \\nbut when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . \\nthe film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . \\nthe script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne . \\nthe biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . \\ndug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor . \\nryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . \\nthe most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . \\nthe bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters . \\nthe scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . \\ndirector taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . \\nproof of life is a thinking man's action movie . \\nit is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night . \\n\", b'slavery is bad . \\nafter hundreds of years , we\\'ve finally figured that one out . \\nthis almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg\\'s latest \" serious \" film . \\nduring the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa\\'s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . \\nfifty-three of them are stuffed into the \" la amistad \" ( from a spanish word for \" friendship \" ) by their new spanish owners . \\nfreeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . \\nafter killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . \\ninstead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . \\nthe amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . \\nthe legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . \\nif they are property , who do they belong to ? \\ntheir masters ? \\nthe spanish government ? \\nsalvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? \\nthe us government ? \\nthe defendants are pawns in several games . \\nabolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . \\ntheir lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . \\nsouth carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . \\npresident martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . \\nwhen the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . \\neven that doesn\\'t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . \\nat the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . \\nthis little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america\\'s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . \\nthe slavery issue is easy pickin\\'s for spielberg . \\nmuch like his \" shindler\\'s list \" ( which followed \" jurassic park \" as this follows \" lost world \" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . \\nnazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . \\nit\\'s not hard to see who the bad guys are . \\nwithout that question to ponder , the director\\'s job is more difficult . \\nhe has to make the story interesting . \\nspielberg succeeds for the most part . \\nthe visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . \\nwhere the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . \\nthere are very few _people_ in the tale . \\nin fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . \\ntappan and joadson are \" abolitionists \" : symbols but not humans . \\nvan buren is a weak politician but nothing else . \\nthe rest of the \" slaves \" barely exist other than dressing for the set . \\nlike many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . \\nthe film\\'s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . \\nthe former model\\'s first major role is a winner . \\nwithout speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . \\nthe other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in \" nixon \" ) . \\nthe impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . \\nthere are some other great moments . \\nespecially impressive are the african\\'s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . \\ntheir interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . \\nas grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . \\nmore humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film . \\n ( michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films . ) \\n', b'alchemy is steeped in shades of blue . \\nkieslowski\\'s blue , that is . \\nwith its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers\\' new independent film echoes the polish director\\'s internationally-acclaimed 1993 release . \\nlanguage aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character\\'s world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm\\'s length . \\nas a result , while we\\'re able to appreciate the film\\'s intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant . \\nalchemy is divided into three chapters : \" charity \" , \" faith \" , and \" hope \" . \\nwhile there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) . \\nwhen the film opens , she\\'s living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her . \\nfollowing his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa\\'s life is thrown into turmoil . \\nevents swirls around her , and she can\\'t find a source of stability . \\nin her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend\\'s mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a \" back-to- nature \" cult . \\nalchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues . \\nin addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art . \\ndoes personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ? \\nare artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ? \\nmyers\\' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context . \\nthrough louisa\\'s struggles , she succeeds . \\nwhile alchemy isn\\'t always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination . \\neven when we\\'re not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there\\'s enough material on-screen to hold our attention . \\nthe cinematography is stunning . \\ncity scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film\\'s early portions . \\nlater , when louisa reaches the \" wilderness \" , we\\'re treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground . \\nit\\'s a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa\\'s life as she travels the road back to emotional stability . \\nthe title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use \" alchemy \" to provide for the needs of the body and soul . \\nand , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it\\'s ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace . \\nher pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life\\'s ultimate goal . \\neven though louisa\\'s final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it\\'s still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch . \\nalchemy isn\\'t pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it\\'s close . \\n', b'the word to describe sharon stone is \" wonder \" . \\nnot that she _is_ a wonder , but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent . \\nshe has a dynamic screen presence in \" basic instinct \" , turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in \" casino \" , but possesses neither of those here . \\nstone teams up with private school headmaster\\'s wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani\\'s thoroughly unlikable husband ( chazz palminteri ) . \\nin a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock ( as in `homage to\\' [read \" steal from \" ] ) , it turns out that someone saw them or he\\'s not dead or maybe . . . \\nkathy bates turns in a credible , if unspectacular , performance as an investigative police detective . \\nher character is a bit dull but realistic , although her actions at the end are puzzling . \\nadjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation . \\nit\\'s stone that is a disappointment among the actors . \\nhow can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one ? \\ncostumed in skin-tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone , she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring , not enticingly dangerous . \\neven the threat ( or promise ? ) of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out . \\non the positive side , there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive . \\nthat is if you can put up with stone\\'s cardboard cut-out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch\\'s movies . \\n', b'years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level . \\nthe same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery . \\n_brazil_ is on my personal top ten . \\n_the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios . \\ni even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends . \\n_what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery . \\nthe daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized . \\nit\\'s idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises . \\nit would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind\\'s eye_ videos . \\nrobin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him . \\nthe director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife . \\nbig mistake . \\nit would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it\\'s a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra ) . \\ninstead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses . \\nit doesn\\'t . \\nso in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don\\'t meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there . \\nhmm . . . \\ni+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative . \\n ( the \" not meeting god \" part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect ) . \\nthat said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense . \\nread on . . . \\nchris\\' wife commits suicide . \\nsince suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever . \\nthe important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ? \\ngood question . \\nand i like good thought-provoking questions . \\ni don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question . \\ni _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously . \\ni _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects . \\nhey chris : did you forget ? \\nyour thoughts are _real_ . \\nthey are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay . \\nso , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ? \\nand then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ? \\nbecause there would be no movie , that+s why . \\nand albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr . ) says bluntly : \" that+s fantasy . \" \\numm . . . \\nif your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real . \\nsurely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that . \\nand if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren\\'t big enough to sustain you for eternity , well , in all due respect , that\\'s why i don\\'t subscribe to this theology . \\nall due respect . \\nanother idea , based on \" time , ( pause ) , does not exist here ! \" \\nso chris , spend your eternity with annie , as she is on earth , reliving your favorite memories , or hang out with her when she was growing up . \\nyou+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out . \\nand forcing her to write \" i still exist \" in her diary , imo , is just too tacky . \\nthere are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot . \\nthe great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before , and just come out stale . \\nmost insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along . \\nand when this happens , the film runs in slow motion , as if to build emotion . \\n_gag me with a spoon_ . \\nso the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance , who rises far above this mundane material , and the special effects . \\nplease note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals , i did not enjoy _all_ of them : some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe , everybody floating up and down in invisible strings . \\nit sounds like a joke , but it+s really true : i really tried to block out the dialogue , and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack . \\nmy vote goes to a rare cd called \" never say die \" ( 1981 ) from petra , a christian rock group . \\nit+s pretty good , and they have a song about annie , who commits suicide . \\n ( it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we\\'d have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late . . . ) . \\nmelancholic , yes . \\ndepressing , yes . \\nbut far more entertaining . . . \\nso , in case you don+t know , let me be straight . \\nsuicide--bad . \\n_don+t do it_ . \\nno . no . no . ( got it ? --you \\nshouldn+t have to pay $7 . 50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest . ) \\n', b'i don\\'t expect much from eddie murphy these days . \\nfor the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . \\nsuch films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . \\nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . \\nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . \\nsherman has just invented a new \" youth drink \" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . \\njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . \\nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . \\nwith some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the \" buddy love \" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . \\nbut one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . \\nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . \\nthen the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . \\nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? \\nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . \\npure and simple , the klumps is a failure . \\nits script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . \\nany sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . \\nit\\'s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . \\nhey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . \\nthe characterization of sherman\\'s family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . \\neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . \\nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . \\nthe father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . \\nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . \\nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . \\nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . \\nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . \\nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . \\nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldn\\'t act like this all the time . \\nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . \\nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . \\nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . \\neven the best effects can\\'t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . \\nnow that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . \\npeople will be lined up around the block for it . \\nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . \\neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he\\'ll play every character in the movie . \\ni just can\\'t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . \\n', b'the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ , which explains why the bard\\'s materials are such a popular source for remakes , revisions , rewrites , inspiration , subtlety , credit , and dispute . \\nindeed , in recent years , american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products . \\nincluding this year\\'s upcoming a midsummer night\\'s dream , shakespeare\\'s material has been the cause for twenty-six big screen productions since 1990 . \\nbut for a change of pace , mrs . \\nbrown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love . \\nmarc norman and tom stoppard\\'s story is largely fantasy , although as the viewer soon learns , shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously . \\n ( will shakespeare of the 1590\\'s would\\'ve been married to anne hathaway , and he would\\'ve had a teenage daughter and two young sons ; here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes . ) will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play , and his current comedy in the works -- \" romeo and ethel , the pirate\\'s daughter \" -- just doesn\\'t quite seem right . \\nwith the help of the great writer christopher marlowe ( rupert everett ) , and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) , he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies , \" romeo and juliet . \" \\nthe love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet , to great effect . \\nfiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum ; this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy . \\nthe supporting roles are well filled out , from geoffrey rush as will\\'s worrisome agent , philip , to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman . \\neven ben affleck , leading the troupe of actors , manages to make a favorable impression ; and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i . gwyneth paltrow is by far , however , the standout of the lot , creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance . \\nthe story is well-crafted if nothing else , although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the \" let\\'s make a movie \" -genre . \\nthe dialogue is breezy and lighthearted , and certainly accessible by the audience\\'s lowest common denominator . \\nthere\\'s something for everyone in this romantic comedy , making it prime date flick material . \\nalthough certainly not inspiring in any regard , it revels in a wholesome , well-rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998\\'s pictures ; the true-love story is one of the best around . \\ncertainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year\\'s-open releases is just around the corner . \\n', b\"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . \\nnew line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . \\nthe fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . \\nit also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . \\nthis time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . \\nby all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . \\none is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . \\ncalling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . \\nbut smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . \\nviewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . \\nthere is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . \\ndirector walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . \\nwhat he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . \\nyes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . \\nthe problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . \\nthey were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . \\nwith john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . \\nit feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . \\nthe narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . \\neven if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . \\nwillis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . \\nchristopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . \\nwith no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . \\ncinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . \\nsometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . \\nin the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . \\n\", b'if you haven\\'t plunked down your hard-earned money yet for \" wild wild west , \" the latest summer holiday offering from will smith , let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck\\'s frappacino or on a ben & jerry\\'s sundae . \\nthese treats are great relief from the summer heat . \\nin contrast , this film made me simmer in disappointment . \\ni can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat . \\nthis was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat . \\nin this film , they are no where to be found . \\nwhat remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats , lots of female extras who look like can-can dancers , and a clunky , 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula . \\ntwo men are asked to stop this threat . \\none is artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents . \\namong his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest . \\nthe other man is jim west ( will smith ) , who prefers the shoot-first-then-shoot-some-more method of investigating . \\nalthough their individual talents must be combined to achieve success , their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate , two-man vaudevillian act . \\nfor example , there is a scene where west , being more debonair than the reserved gordon , notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat , which is what it is currently filled with . \\n \" now touch my breast , \" west says . \\ngordon does so and then softly coos his approval . \\ni found myself groaning at this kind of silliness . \\nthe script fails to generate any sense of drama , humor , or fun for that matter . \\ni did enjoy kline\\'s reserved performance , but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith . \\ncould it be that will smith is just so bankable that he\\'s not even required to act ? \\nit was as if the director was yelling \" will smith , do your own thing . . . and \\naction ! \" \\nhere\\'s an example . \\nin this scene , will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people . \\nhe must endear himself to the crowd to escape . \\nthe director yells , \" will smith , do your own thing . . . and \\naction ! \" \\nin another scene , he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades . \\n \" will smith , do your own thing . . . and \\naction ! \" \\nworse still , the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess . \\nthere are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look . \\nthere\\'s actually a lot of imagination at work in this film . \\nthere are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced , but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat . \\nand that\\'s too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his \\'thing , \\' this film might have been palatable . \\nas it turns out , \" wild wild west \" is the wild , wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year . \\n', b\"movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office . \\nbut when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well . \\nwith a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . \\nit got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' . \\nand , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video . \\nin the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity . \\nthe mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation . \\nmk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition . \\ndespite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth . \\noutworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel . \\nearth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces . \\nit's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie . \\nit is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story . \\nthis becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more . \\nthey are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act . \\nthis becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana . \\nthe original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best . \\nthey spoke little , but fought a lot . \\nthus , the movie was easy to digest . \\nhowever , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably . \\nthis uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak . \\nnot only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g . \\nuseless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom . \\ntry reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean . \\nbut the movie is not a complete fatality . \\nfight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility . \\nand players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo . \\neven if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves . \\nbut it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect . \\noddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence . \\nand the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival . \\n ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) . \\nrent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . \\n\", b'dr . alan grant ( sam neill , \" jurassic park \" ) is becoming disillusioned . \\npaleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter . \\nhis lectures bring people interested in his adventures on isla nubla rather than his research and funding dollars are drying up . \\nwhen the kirbys ( william h . macy , \" fargo \" ; tea leoni , \" the family man \" ) ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna ( the notorious site b of \" the lost world \" ) he\\'s disdainful , but once they wave their checkbook , he reconsiders . \\nhowever the kirbys haven\\'t given dr . grant their real agenda in \" jurassic park iii . \" \\nof course , we , the audience , have been tipped off , given that the film begins by showing us eric ( trevor morgan , \" the patriot \" ) , a young boy , and ben ( mark harelik , \" election \" ) going for a paragliding adventure off that same island that goes awry ( and looks like cheesy rear projection ) . \\ngrant\\'s established back home with a new right hand man , billy brennan ( alessandro nivola , \" love\\'s labour\\'s lost \" ) on site at a dig in montana sorely lacking funds . \\nhe also pays a visit to old flame dr . ellie sattler ( laura dern , \" jurassic park \" ) , now married to another with a young son who calls grant \\'the dinosaur man\\' apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the film\\'s poorly imagined finale . \\ngrant takes billy along on the kirbys trip , which is really an illegal gambit to save their son , that young paraglider . \\nthe couple aren\\'t millionaires , making grant\\'s check bogus , and they\\'re separated as well ( eric was with amanda\\'s new boyfriend , not that that makes much sense ) , meaning we\\'re in for some gooey family dynamics while waiting for the dino dining . \\nthe kirbys hired hands ( and obvious bait ) are a threesome led by mr . udesky ( michael jeter , \" the gift \" ) . \\n ( didn\\'t anyone consider that casting michael jeter and william h . macy together and not having them be related was a little odd ? ) \\nas directed by joe johnston ( \" october sky , \" \" jumanji \" ) ( spielberg only produced this one ) from a risible script by peter buchman and the \" election \" team of alexander payne & jim taylor , \" jurassic park iii \" is nothing more than a quickie monster flick with a couple of new dinos ( a spinosauraus , which goes head to head with the t-rex , and pteranodons ) . \\nthe plot , as it were , is a series of coincidences combined with extreme leaps of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks . \\nthe effects are no longer new , and , as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson , rather murky looking at times . \\nfilm editing by robert dalva ( \" october sky \" ) was presumably done by machete , to keep this down to a 90 minute run time . \\ni know of no other reason to explain the ridiculous ending which features the survivors confronting a pack of raptors , then being saved by the most ludicrous of logic jumps within a few minutes . \\n\\'original\\' music by don davis just repeats john williams\\' original themes . \\nwhile neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and humanity into the proceedings , the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional . \\n \" jurassic park iii \" will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect , the same crowd who maybe liked \" the lost world : jurassic park . \" \\n', b'i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer . \\nit\\'s pretty good in it\\'s own right , yes , but i would probably split the \" best movie \" honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon . \\nit\\'s main problem is that it\\'s quickly forgettable , and i can\\'t remember one truly good scene from it . \\nfrom con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt . \\nin spawn , it was the \" living room hell \" conclusion at the end . \\nin event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell\\'s forces . \\nand all of face/off was pretty dang good . \\nbut as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches . \\ni remember it not for it\\'s humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted . \\nand yes , i did see mimic , which is something i\\'ll touch on in a later review . \\nback to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? ) \\ni remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc . ( for those of you who aren\\'t comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy\\'s life is to boy scots . \\nokay , that one was pretty pathetic . ) \\nfew people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find . \\nthis was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o\\'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black . \\nkind of weird , huh ? ) \\nall i can say is , thank god they didn\\'t cast chris o\\'donnell . \\ni know i can\\'t be the only person on the planet who thinks he\\'s an annoying , preppie little snot . . . \\nsorry . \\nmy apologies to o\\'donnell fans . \\ni actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely . \\nhe decided not to sell them to me , because they were \" innappropriate \" . \\nhmm . . . . \\nso now you\\'re probably wondering why i\\'ve wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years . \\ngood question . \\ni\\'ll move on to the movie now . \\nas you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it\\'s nickname mib ( men in black . ) \\nmen in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they\\'re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they\\'re here on earth . \\nnot to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven\\'t seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer\\'s yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe . \\nnot bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that . \\ni\\'m not even really paying attention anymore . ) \\nthe special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black . \\ni found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the \" cool weapons \" they had . \\nthe noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said . \\nand the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln\\'t have . \\nit\\'s director , barry sonnenfield , is known for \" black humor \" , directing both addams family movies . \\nthis movie was basically a \" black comedy \" , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong on what i think of this movie . \\nit\\'s not bad , i gave it * * * . \\nit was mostly entertaining throughout it\\'s run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it . \\nmy diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket . \\nof course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that\\'s beside the point . \\ni think . \\n', b'synopsis : easily-angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce . \\ndiedre easily cons david\\'s not-so-bright new wife molly into believing she\\'s a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david\\'s quick-tempered son , michael . \\ndiedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people . \\ncomments : the ex is a very bad movie . \\ni haven\\'t seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while . \\ni kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars ) . \\nas summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie . \\ni\\'m not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000 . \\nthe ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn\\'t take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind ) . \\nthose involved in the movie realize they\\'re in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script . \\nthe ex\\'s storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie . \\ndiedre , david\\'s first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it\\'s not as though she\\'s bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime ) . \\ndavid and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger . \\nthough david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made . \\nmolly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she\\'s a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son . \\ntime and time again , things do not add up in this movie . \\nif a viewer can\\'t accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex . \\nif , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he\\'ll probably like it much better . \\ni don\\'t mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp . \\neven when viewed from an it\\'s-so-bad-it\\'s-good angle , this movie isn\\'t all that successful . \\nthe ex does have its moments , though , almost all of which involve yancy butler ( the psychotic diedre ) and nick mancuso ( david ) . \\nthese two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which , oftentimes , elicit chuckles from the audience . \\nthe truly awful lines written for them help this humor along . \\nbutler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue ; every time her character kills someone , she has a punchline that\\'s unbelievably inane . \\nwhen she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david , for example , diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states \" i\\'m so sorry , your lease is terminated . \" \\nor how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ? \\n ( diedre\\'s therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it\\'s not her\\'s . \\ntherapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies ) . \\nhaving successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : \" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ? \\noh , that\\'s right . \\n\\'i\\'m sorry , but your time is up ! \\' \" \\nthis is what passes for humor in the film . \\nthe audience doesn\\'t necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can\\'t believe they\\'re watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . \\nnick mancuso\\'s chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler\\'s character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . \\nin between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie\\'s best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is . \\nin exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts \" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! \" \\n ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) \\nand so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . \\ni won\\'t reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . \\nmolly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! \\nmolly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family\\'s to spy upon them , that \" she\\'s crazy . \" \\nyou\\'d be pretty crazy too if you\\'d rented this turkey . \\ni\\'d avoid it unless it\\'s on tv and you come across it . \\nif you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn\\'t spend money renting it . \\n', b'david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director . \\nwith his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible . \\nsome of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline . \\nand although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right . \\noh , and it\\'s rated g . \\nincidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else\\'s work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century . \\nhe casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note . \\n \" did you do it ? \" he asks his boy . \\n \" no father , i didn\\'t , \" ronnie answers . \\nthat\\'s enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son\\'s case to court . \\nthey enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task . \\nit all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century . \\nbut arthur is determined to keep his family\\'s word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that . \\nsoon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings . \\nso do we . \\nall david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent . \\nthe characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense . \\nbut this is not mamet\\'s norm , and it\\'s refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were . \\nnigel hawthorne\\'s performance is nearly flawless . \\nhis delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game . \\nwe pity the man , but we also like him . \\nrebecca pidgeon , david mamet\\'s wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur\\'s oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women\\'s suffrage movement . \\nthe winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one . \\nbe honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ? \\nif you wanted to but didn\\'t , this is a movie for you . \\nit is the epitome of subtlety : it\\'s powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing . \\ndavid mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too . \\nhe is almost a national treasure . \\nhis films deserve their own genre . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n', b'for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and \" high art , \" the son\\'s room is an inventive , subtle alternative . \\nwritten by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . \\nslow is the best description for the film at first . \\nit takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . \\nfather and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . \\nthey laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . \\nyou get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . \\nbut suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . \\nthe family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . \\nthough the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . \\nthough nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn\\'t come across as a vanity piece . \\none might wish he hadn\\'t picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character\\'s reactions so predictable . \\nwhat saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . \\nthe potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . \\nyou start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . \\nyou remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . \\neven better are the role reversals that take place within the household . \\nwhile giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . \\nnot only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she\\'ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . \\nthese scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . \\nrespectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . \\nself-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . \\nthough giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . \\nmost films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . \\nin contrast , the son\\'s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . \\nit\\'s not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to . \\n', b'i\\'ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski . \\nthe part of jeff \" the dude \" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect . \\nthe dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . \\nhe\\'s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . \\nafter much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug . \\nthe dude assumes that these \" collection agents \" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . \\nthe millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . \\nhe wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . \\ndude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers . \\ncomedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny . \\nit is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . \\nnot only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . \\nall the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . \\neach person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . \\nthe characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh . \\nit\\'s not what they do that\\'s funny , it\\'s who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie . \\nworth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that\\'s jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who\\'s in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as \" vaginal ; \" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator . \\naside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . \\npeople lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . . \\nthey sound natural . \\ntaken with fargo , the coen brothers\\' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . \\nethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he\\'s also good at technical directing . \\nhe and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . \\nperhaps \" beautiful \" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . \\nbut the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . \\nall around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy . \\noutstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success . \\n', b\"just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . \\neither way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . \\nwhy is this ? \\nmaybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . \\ndirector stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . \\nwhen watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . \\ni laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . \\ni laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . \\nand i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . \\nrob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . \\nhe uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . \\nand like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . \\nhe spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . \\nwhatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . \\ngrasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . \\nrob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . \\nduring this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . \\nbut these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . \\nthe plot in three words is : women and music . \\nthe approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . \\nit gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . \\nit also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . \\njack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . \\njust listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . \\nwhat frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . \\njohn cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . \\nnow instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . \\nthe only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . \\ninstead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . \\nalso bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . \\nhigh fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . \\ni just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . \\n\", b'countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally . \\nluckily , movie reviewers aren\\'t burdened with such legislation . \\notherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer . \\nin case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans . \\nin any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times . \\nthose who don\\'t usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery . \\nthe author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film . \\nlike so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since . \\nperhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away . \\nor perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before . \\nanyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life . \\nand it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas\\' epic . \\nstar wars wasn\\'t just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment ) . \\nit was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema . \\nuntil than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood\\'s financial and technical resources to create serious , \" personal \" or \" artsy \" movies . \\nas a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn\\'t want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen . \\ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue . \\nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood . \\nserious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of \" blockbuster \" philosophy . \\none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre . \\nuntil 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain . \\nin late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn\\'t look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey . \\nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies . \\nhowever , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn\\'t like it . \\nas a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s . \\nafter that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment . \\nironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of \" new hollywood \" generation of young movie authors who made \" artsy \" and \" personal \" films in early 1970s . \\ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti . \\nboth movies were considered \" personal \" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular . \\nin a sense , star wars is an also very \" personal \" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it . \\nbut unlike many \" personal \" movies of the era , its \" personality \" was in line with the wishes of the general audience . \\nthe plot , set \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away \" , begins in a time of civil war . \\nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic . \\nin order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets . \\nthe information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser . \\nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) . \\nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot . \\nhis adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) . \\nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force . \\nafter some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force . \\ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) . \\ncritics who don\\'t like the movie , especially those who can\\'t forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of \" new hollywood \" , are prone to point the lack of originality . \\non the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa\\'s samurai classic the hidden fortress . \\non the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) . \\nthe others would find the author\\'s element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes . \\neven out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art . \\ngeorge lucas\\' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup . \\ncharacters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster . \\nwe have a \" coming-of-age \" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters . \\nsome of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form . \\nunfortunately , the same can\\'t be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career . \\nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology . \\noften comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas\\' superiority over kubrick . \\nhowever , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren\\'t the most remembered trademark of the movie . \\nthat honour should definitely go to the \" oscar \" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career . \\nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release . \\nyet , even if they are immune to the george lucas\\' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture . \\n', b'why do people hate the spice girls ? \\n ? what exactly have they done wrong , other than perhaps offend the fashion police ? \\n ? so what if they are not \" great \" singers---they ain\\'t singing opera , folks , its pop music ! \\n ? who exactly is a \" great \" singer ? \\njudging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that i like the spice girls . \\n ? they do what they do--sing some catchy tunes--and they do it pretty well . \\n ? they are able to carry that into their first film , \" spice world \" . \\n ? \" spice world \" certainly isn\\'t a great filmgoing experience . \\n . \\n . \\nwhat it is what the spice girls are all about : fun , songs , and a lot of \" girl power ! \" \\ndrawing from a number of different films ( like the beatles\\' \" hard day\\'s night \" ) \" spice world \" chronicles the week heading up to the girls\\' first concert at london\\'s albert hall . \\n ? they get to tool around london in a big ol\\' bus ( driven by meat loaf ! ) and generally have fun . \\n ? in order to through a semblence of plot into the film , there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries , better known to americans , for about 15 minutes , as dame edna ( remember her ? ) \\n ? he wants to sabotage the girls\\' concert so he can sell papers . \\nof course , the point in a movie like \" spice world \" isn\\'t plot . \\n ? the center of the film is the spice girls themselves : ginger ( the recently departed geri haliwell ) , posh ( victoria adams ) , sporty ( melanie chisolm ) , scary ( melanie brown ) , and baby ( emma bunton ) . \\n ? each one has their own personality and , perhaps the best part of the film , look like they are having some honest-to-goodness fun , something that can\\'t be said for a lot of people in films today . \\nalong for the ride are richard e . grant as their manager , clifford , and various other characters making quick cameo appearances ( including teriffic british actors like richard briers and stephen fry ) . \\n ? and , every once and a while , roger moore pops up as the chief to spout odd koans ( added bonus : he gets to , in the words of craig kilborn , dance , dance , dance . ) \\nwatching this film was fun , for the most part . \\n ? there are a few slow segments , but overly , director bob spiers keeps things moving at a quick pace , with plenty of hummable spice girls songs in the background . \\n ? his camerawork is fairly pedestrian , though the final concert number is done quite well with effective use of editing . \\n ? \\nthe look of the film promotes the high fun , with the design of the spicebus being quite original and eye-catching . \\n ? add in wall-to-wall spice girls music and this film is lovable romp . \\n ? if you don\\'t like the spice girls , you won\\'t change your mind with this film . \\n ? but , if you find them at least tolerable , get ready to sit back and chill because the spice girls are here to entertain you . \\n . \\n . \\nand do it quite well . \\n ? \\n \" spice world \" ( 1998 ) . \\n ? directed by bob spiers . \\n ? written by kim fuller .

foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then \" bully \" \\'s for you . \\nbased on jim schutze\\'s novelization of a true-life event , \" bully \" charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood . \\nthe film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers . \\nin the hands of controversial director larry clark ( \" kids \" ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker\\'s pornographic proclivities . \\nin terms of the incident and what provoked it , \" bully \" stirs up nothing new . \\nthe high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane . \\nthe bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn\\'t exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department . \\nhe hounds and harries and humiliates his \" best friend \" marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty\\'s girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn\\'t care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby . \\nsimply remove him from the equation . \\nmarty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off . \\nthere\\'s no remorse--the next day they\\'re talking about it as openly as a homework assignment . \\nthey did it because they wanted to , and because they could . \\nwhat\\'s most troubling about the film , however , isn\\'t the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material . \\nnot only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in \" bully \" but there\\'s also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it . \\ngratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in \" there\\'s something about mary \" look like the height of subtlety ! ) . \\nclark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about . \\nthe stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera . \\nthe conclusion of \" bully \" offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime . \\nit\\'s a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it\\'s infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it . \\n \" bully \" aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death . \\n', b'here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy \" bait \" starring jamie foxx and david morse . \\nthis is a review i

, the farrelly brothers+ latest film . \\ni knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . \\nbut i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . \\ni figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell . \\ni may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? \\ni needn+t have worried . \\n+mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_ . \\nsurprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers . \\nthey make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy . \\nthe plot is typical . \\nthirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom . \\nas luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized . \\nwhy , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty . \\nhe hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon ) . \\nhe becomes one of the great comic villains . \\nupon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped . \\nit is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself . \\nwould the geek get the girl ? \\npuh-lease . \\nthe ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there . \\nbut the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs . \\nthe dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame . \\nand yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone . \\nmary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful . \\nshe is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w . \\nearl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ ) . \\nmary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you . \\ncameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window . \\nben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser . \\nbraces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny . \\ndillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth . \\nand rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) . \\nnot everything works . \\nchris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring . \\nthere+s lousy dialogue about eight-minute vs . seven minute exercise tapes . \\nand there are long stretches without much going on . \\nbut the wait is worth it . \\nwhen those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears . \\nbelly-aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene . \\nthe farrelly brothers have finally done it . \\nyes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been . \\nwhile tasteless , it didn+t cross any lines , at least not with me . \\nwhile raunchy , it wasn+t nearly as bad as _porky+s_ or _boogie nights_ . \\nand it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick . \\nafter the funny but sour _kingpin_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate , comes the funniest sex farce since _a fish called wanda_ . \\napproach this with an open mind , and you will reap the benefits hugely . \\n', b'in \" twilight , \" a

\\nwith an a-list cast of oscar laureates like that , \" twilight \" would seem very promising . \\nhowever , the script is tired and predictable . \\nit would serve well as a tv-movie-of-the-week , possibly with some 1970\\'s detective hero reprising his role . \\nthe appeal of the project for its stars and its director , robert benton , is nostalgia . \\n \" twilight \" wants very much to be a

who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation . \\nthe script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 . \\nelmer bernstein\\'s score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir . \\nthe lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script . \\nthey try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters . \\nharry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine . \\njack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry\\'s love for catherine . \\ncatherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer . \\n \" twilight \" wants to be character-driven like \" nobody\\'s fool \" ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with . \\n \" twilight \" also squanders a fine supporting cast : stockard channing ( harry\\'s friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine\\'s bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry\\'s nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) . \\n', b' \" it was not scary . \" \\nthese are the first words that came to mind after it was over . \\nwhen a movie is called _vampires_ , \" not scary \" aren\\'t words that should be associated with it . \\nbut that wasn\\'t my only gripe . \\njohn carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema , as in the intense scares of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ . \\nunfortunately , the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach . \\nwith an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter\\'s vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan . \\nthe film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led by james woods , of all people . \\nlike some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack . \\ntheir method is amusingly innovative : the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks . \\nto commemorate their victory , the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away . \\ntheir celebration is short-lived , however , as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single-handedly destroys most of the team . \\nwoods\\' jack crow and buddy montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escape with their lives , along with a woman named katrina ( sheryl lee ) . \\nalthough the woman has been bitten , montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire . \\nthe rest of the movie is concerned with the boys\\' hunt for valek ( thomas ian griffith ) , a freaky marilyn manson-type who\\'s on a mission that dates back 600 years . \\nalong the way they pick up a priest named guiteau ( tim guinee ) , a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl . \\nupham in _saving private ryan_ . \\nsome stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but i can\\'t remember most of it , because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen . \\n_vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest . \\nonly then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick . \\nbut it\\'s too little too late . \\nwe get the inevitable final confrontation , but it seems tacked on and rather anti-climactic ( come on , we\\'re dealing with _the_ master vampire here ! ) \\ninterestingly , last summer\\'s vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former , a more deliberate superhero flick . \\nwoods\\' jack crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride . \\nand his motive for killing vampires ? \\ntake a wild guess . \\n ( hint : a ______ killed his _____ when he was just a _____ . ) \\nat least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness . \\n_vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot . \\nto make up for this , the movie resorts to other \" shocks , \" such as its generally condescending attitude towards women ( crow slaps them around for the fun of it ) and an overplayed contempt for religion ( crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to \" getting woodies . \" ) \\nit can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie . \\nif not scary and gory , i wanted tense , relentless , and exhausting . \\n_john carpenter\\'s vampires_ is none of these . \\ni can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan . \\nfor the rest of you looking for a good scare , beware : _vampires_ is a film with no teeth . \\n', b'what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life ? \\nyou get martin lawrence in a coma ( the comedian thought he was getting fat ,

just that awful . \\n', b\"now , lets first look into the history of shark films . \\nthere was the unforgettable jaws . \\nthe exciting jaws 2 . the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can't seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) . \\nnow , with the magic of cgi , one shark is simply not enough ; in deep blue sea , there are 3 big , mean and really smart ones ! \\nrussell frankiln ( jackson ) visits aquatica ( a sea-bound research center ) , where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer's disease . \\nthe substance is small in quantity and because of this , lead researcher dr . susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans , naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones . \\nas sure as the sun sets in the west , a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure . \\nwith the flexibility offered by cgi , the sharks get more full-length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote-controlled rubber suit days . \\ngone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after . \\nthis time , we get to see the entire gobbling action , with floating limbs and all . \\nso-so acting , expected in most of your average action film . \\njackson ( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace ) , takes on the dark-side force of a different kind and fits well with his wise-cracking lines . \\nll cool j's cook role as preacher , does for this film what steven seagal's cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films . \\ndeep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer . \\nit does however , prove to be a refreshing follow-up within the genre , full of visual thrills , suspense and believe it or not \\x05 humour ! \\nits like jurassic park under water . \\nnothing too stressful , pure entertainment . \\nrenny harlin , you are forgiven ( for making cutthroat island ) . \\n\", b'in zoolander , the world\\'s most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , \" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? \" \\nobviously , the film\\'s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? \\nno , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . \\nmuch like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . \\nit\\'s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek\\'s model roommates all die in a tragic \" gasoline fight \" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . \\nbut it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . \\nbetter yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . \\nzoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . \\nfashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . \\nenter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . \\non the trail of mugatu\\'s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller\\'s real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she\\'s hoping to use mugatu\\'s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . \\nmuch like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . \\nwilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . \\nferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . \\njerry stiller -- ben\\'s dad who\\'s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek\\'s slimy agent maury ballstein . \\neven ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . \\nas for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he\\'s stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . \\nunfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . \\nmaybe it\\'s just because i can\\'t stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn\\'t had sex in two years . \\nshe leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would\\'ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role . \\nwhile zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . \\nzoolander\\'s no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction . \\n', b'capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . \\nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver\\'s travels and treat it as an action film . \\nthat makes it a film without much center . \\n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \\npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \\nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver\\'s travels . \\nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift\\'s island of the houyhnhnms . \\nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \\nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \\nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \\nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \\nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \\ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \\nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \\nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \\nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \\njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \\nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \\nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \\npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith\\'s best if not his best . \\nwhen the film\\'s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \\nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \\nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \\nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \\nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton\\'s new version is even less faithful . \\nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \\nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \\nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \\nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \\nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world\\'s most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \\nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \\n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \\nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \\nand the language they talk is earth- english . \\napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \\nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn\\'t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \\nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \\nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \\noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \\nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \\nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \\nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \\nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \\nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \\nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \\nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \\nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \\nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each\\'s place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \\nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \\nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \\nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \\nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \\nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \\nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn\\'t like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \\nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \\nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \\nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \\nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \\nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \\nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \\nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \\ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker\\'s visualization is really an improvement . \\nthese visuals work nicely . \\nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \\napes spring incredible distances . \\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \\nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \\nbut he delivers them very well . \\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \\nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \\nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\\'s performance in spartacus . \\nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \\ndanny elfman\\'s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith\\'s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \\nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \\ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n', b'only a year after the initial release of \" scream , \" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel \" scream 2 \" has arrived in our theaters . \\nwhile the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it\\'s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . \\nthe first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . \\nthe premise of \" scream 2 \" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called \" stab , \" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in \" scream , \" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . \\ni had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . \\nits conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it\\'s a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . \\nthe satire in \" scream 2 \" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . \\nalthough resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . \\neverything from \" friends \" and \" saved by the bell \" to \" showgirls \" and \" terminator 2 \" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren\\'t any \" wes carpenter \" jokes this time . \\nmore importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . \\nthe killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from \" scream \" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine\\'s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . \\nunderstandably , \" scream 2 \" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . \\ncouple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . \\nwe don\\'t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . \\nwhile i have not seen any of his other work , it\\'s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated \" slasher film \" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . \\nunfortunately , \" scream 2 \" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . \\nfor example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . \\nthere are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . \\nas for the question of whether or not \" scream 2 \" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , it\\'s hard to say . \\ni gave the first \" scream \" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . \\n \" scream 2 \" bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . \\ni\\'m not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck . \\n', b'october sky is a rare oddity in cinema : a self-proclaimed \" uplifting \" film that is actually uplifting ! \\nbased on the autobiographical book by homer hickam , rocket boys , october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream . \\nit\\'s 1957 , and for the boys of coalwood , west virginia , there\\'s not much hope of a rosy future . \\ncoalwood is a coal mining town , and , except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship , most of coalwood\\'s boys are destined to work in the mine . \\nbut , in october 1957 , an event happens that sparks one boy to dream . \\nthe launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) to dream a future of rocketry and space travel . \\nof course , homer\\'s parents ( chris cooper and natalie canderday ) aren\\'t quite sure what to make of their son\\'s unusual interests . \\nhomer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley ( laura dern ) , a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair . \\nand so , with stars in his eyes , and thoughts of scholarships in his head , homer enlists the help of three other boys ( william lee scott , chad lindberg and chris owen ) and begins to build a rocket . \\nbut , do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny ? \\nthere is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky . \\nnearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched . \\nhowever , miraculously , october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls , making the exact right moves at the exact right times . \\na film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness . \\njake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film . \\n>from the outset of the film , he is immediately likable , and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience . \\nunfortunately , while october sky focuses on homer , the other three kids get the short end of the stick . \\nthey remain little more than placeholders reading \" insert friend here \" . \\nof the adults in the film , chris cooper is the most fully realized character . \\nthe film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his child\\'s dreams , but , instead , shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family and town , but is too stubborn to realize what that is . \\ndirector joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge . \\nhowever , there are still a few occasions when he allows things to proceed just a step too far . \\nscenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial . \\nhowever , these lapses are minimal , and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course . \\nthe problem with many so-called \" uplifting \" films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat . \\noctober sky never resorts to that level , and yet , manages to become a truly uplifting film purely on its own merits . \\n', b' \" what\\'s your favorite new york moment ? \" \\n \" this one\\'s climbing the charts . \" \\nstarring john cusack , kate beckinsale , eugene levy , molly shannon . \\ndirected by peter chelsom . \\nrated pg-13 . \\nthere\\'s no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern

, is a romantic comedy as cheap , as obvious , or as pointless as serendipity , a film that uses its \" theme \" as an excuse for its plot contrivances . \\n \" lightweight \" doesn\\'t begin to

aren\\'t content . \\nboth go looking for the other . \\nwhat happens now is so absurd that i\\'m almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it . \\nthe two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible \" coincidences \" that i would describe as contrivances if it weren\\'t for the film oh-so-cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around \" serendipity . \" \\nof course , since the movie is about fate , the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases . \\ni\\'m not buying it . \\nthere\\'s no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what\\'s going to happen , but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly \" adorable \" non-story into our heads . \\ninstead of \" will they meet ? \" \\nthe question we\\'re asking is \" when will they meet already ? \" \\nto make matters worse , every \" coincidence \" is telegraphed from a mile away ; by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else \" incredible \" was going to happen . \\ncusack is fine and beckinsale , at least , isn\\'t saddled with another lumbering , clunky screenplay ( she\\'s had bad luck , what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume ) , just an inanely pointless one . \\nserendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy , who plays a snarky bloomingdale\\'s salesman . \\nwhat\\'s the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined ( no pun intended ) conclusion ? \\nserendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings , but it only tests our patience . \\n', b'as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . \\nwith the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a \" great \" piece of work and viceversa . \\nattempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . \\ni avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . \\nas the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . \\nas such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . \\ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . \\ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . \\nit is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . \\nall the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . \\nthe classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . \\nit is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . \\nthe elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . \\nthe paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . \\nthe fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . \\nthere need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . \\nas in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . \\ndo not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed . \\nfor those who are put off by the \" art \" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . \\nthere are no weak performances in this movie . \\nmichelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . \\nchow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . \\nzhang ziyi is a budding superstar . \\nshe is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . \\ncheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . \\nkudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . \\nang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . \\nthis is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . \\ndon\\'t miss it . \\n', b\"it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar . \\nwhy ? \\nthe movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey' . \\ni got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon' . \\nbut no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster . \\nthis is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel . \\nyou have been warned . \\nof course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation . \\nbrian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off . \\nwhen he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) . \\nof course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' ) . . . . \\nall of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood . \\nthat term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient . \\nif i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole . \\nsinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration . \\nthe academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) . \\nafter a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet . \\nsuddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction . \\nfor some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art . \\nthe team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive . \\nimmediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars . \\nlet's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there . \\nit is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months . \\ni'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia . \\ninstead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship . \\nwhat happened during the five months prior to this ? \\ndid they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? \\nstill , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak . \\ndepalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ? \\nc'mon ) . \\nthere's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud . \\nit's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists . \\nas mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . . \\nmaybe even cheated . \\nafter the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen . \\nothers muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked . ' \\nokay , it did suck . \\nbut you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . . \\nafter all , they do pretty well . \\nsinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o'connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) . \\nthe digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive . \\nso , by golly , where did this `mission' go wrong ? \\nlooking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have . \\nwhile watching `mission to mars' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don't even strap yourself in for lift-off . \\n\", b'david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head . \\nit is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future . \\nthe story unfolds in a near future , where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs . \\nthe world of the future is an unfriendly place , where the scared inhabitants are \" hiding \" in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world . \\nallegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh ) , the leading game designer in the world , is testing her new virtual reality game , existenz with a focus group . \\nas they begin , she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun . \\nshe flees with a young marketing trainee , ted pikul ( jude law ) , who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard . \\nunfortunately , her pod , an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program , is damaged . \\nto inspect it , she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her . \\nthe events leading up to this , and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn\\'t exist , as the \" players \" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot . \\nhere the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game\\'s perspective . \\ni don\\'t intend to reveal more of the film\\'s premise , which is structured as a computer game , with \" tasks \" that the characters must complete to win the game . \\nreleased after \" the matrix \" and \" dark city \" , \" existenz \" has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films . \\nhowever , \" existenz \" is moving in a different direction , with a premise of its own . \\na combination of dazzling special effects , brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot , made \" the matrix \" a rare and entertaining science fiction experience , with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade . \\n \" existenz \" has a completely different atmosphere , resembling \" dark city \" , which is darker , more serious and less entertaining . \\n \" existenz \" has the opportunities and potential , but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored . \\nafter the engaging beginning , it starts to falter . \\nwhile i was watching the film , many left the theatre during the first hour . \\nand indeed , \" existenz \" seemed as a complete failure : the actors seemed unreal , the plot and dialogue silly , unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another . \\nbut the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level , explaining all past events , the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes . \\nand jet the film fails on several issues . \\nprobably the best written character in the story is a game designer , who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world , than face real life . \\nthis is a great possibility to create a magnificent character , and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg\\'s script to the limits , but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown . \\nexistenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies . \\nit is not a world worth sacrificing your life for . \\nit\\'s a cold , dark place where the \" players \" are forced to interrelate with unreal characters , eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will . \\nit doesn\\'t look like a place worth even thinking about . \\ndavid cronenberg has been the creator of \" the fly \" , \" videodrome \" and \" the dead zone \" , so it\\'s not so hard to guess that \" existenz \" is a violent and gory film . \\nbesides the regular murders of innocent people , the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium . \\nscenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can\\'t make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures . \\nthe way i see it , this is the film\\'s crucial failure . \\nit is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time , space and problems of our everyday life do not exist ; a place of blooming blossoms , green forests and clear waters ; a place really worth sacrificing your life for . \\nbecause of its lack of three dimensionality , the film looses most of its possibilities , but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes , amusing performances ( especially by willem dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought , depicted in many different ways throughout the movie . \\nduring the film , the audience is as confused as the characters : detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created . \\n \" the matrix \" , despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts , ends with a light at the end of the tunnel . \\n \" existenz \" does not . \\nit is a one time experience , ending in blood , gore and madness - a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow . \\n', b'one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles . \\nhe has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star . \\nafter sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film . \\nunfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for . \\nwe are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do . \\nthen the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is . \\nthe plot of men with guns can be summarized \" in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas . \\ndr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went . \\nand he found out again and again and again . \" \\nof course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell . \\na guerrilla war is always bad for civilians . \\nbut the film talks down to the viewer . \\ndr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country . \\nhe has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios . \\nfuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service . \\nthen he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy . \\nin shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others . \\nthe student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be . \\nfuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general . \\nthe results are little different than one would expect . \\ndr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive . \\neven some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains . \\nbut fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was . \\nsayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians . \\nthe cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences . \\nfederico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos . \\ndamian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter . \\nmandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer . \\n', b\"this sometimes-tedious and often-moving documentary charts the life and times of anne frank , the young diarist and most-famous victim of adolph hitler . \\nwriter/director/producer jon blair has collected a staggering amount of historical material on both anne and the frank family . \\nwe meet miep gies , one of the family's protectors who is still alive . \\nshe recounts how she found the diary in the days after the germans captured the franks . \\nwe watch otto frank , anne's father and surviving family member , in interview footage filmed before his death . \\nblair successfully combines these clips , footage , and other historical records to recount exactly what happened during that terrible period of european history . \\nas narrated by kenneth branagh and with diary excepts read by glenn close , anne frank remembered retells more than just anne's story . \\nwe meet and learn about the * many * friends , family members , and acquaintances whose lives were touched by this young woman and her writings . \\nwinner of the last year's academy award for best documentary . \\n\", b'i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . \\nusing their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . \\nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . \\nnow , before i continue to ferociously attack what\\'s wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . \\ncatherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . \\nif you\\'ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don\\'t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . \\nthe problem we come to is that we\\'ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn\\'t break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . \\nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived . \\ni\\'m going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . \\nnow while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn\\'t for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . \\njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" . \\nwith an eighty million dollar budget , you\\'d think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . \\nwell , you\\'d be wrong . \\nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . \\nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . \\nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what\\'s going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . \\nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . \\none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . \\nnothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn\\'t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? \\ni\\'ll tell you why : because it\\'s a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones\\' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . \\nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . \\none last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he\\'ll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . \\ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself \" it\\'ll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? \" \\nwe know jon , it\\'s called editing . \\n', b'man , this was one wierd movie . \\nsimilar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn\\'t decide which genre it is . \\nthe first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship . \\nthe last half hour ? \\nthis was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - \" screw it , let\\'s just kill everybody \" . \\nfrom then on - forget sci-fi . . . this \\nmovie becomes 100% horror . \\nwhat really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way . \\ninstead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone\\'s \\nseen it all before and knows when to expect it . \\nthe one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew . \\nthere are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ? \\nthen finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video . \\nthe acting isn\\'t too bad at all . . . . . considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of . \\nthere was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space . \\nthis movie could have been so much better . \\nit had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with . \\nthere was just nothing new here that any of us haven\\'t seen before in aliens or hellraiser . \\n', b'for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro . \\nif the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house . \\nthat extra motive doesn\\'t make happy gilmore a funnier movie . \\nit doesn\\'t really add any genuine emotional depth , either . \\nin fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie . \\nbut sandler\\'s philosophy seems to be , if it\\'s a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? \\nthat is endlessly refreshing . \\nin the wedding singer , sandler is right on track . \\nthe fact that he\\'s a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story . \\nwhat kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important . \\ndavid spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm . \\nhe could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact . \\nbut sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character . \\nhe seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family . \\nrobbie hart ( sandler ) doesn\\'t just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing . \\nhe is exactly the man you would want at your wedding . \\nthe day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 ) . \\nrobbie takes it hard . \\nhe doesn\\'t sleep , he doesn\\'t eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings \" love stinks \" at a wedding . \\njulia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to . \\neventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia . \\nhe really likes her , but she\\'s engaged . \\nher fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn\\'t deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand . \\njulia seems to like robbie too , but she can\\'t leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her . \\nyou know the story . \\nyou\\'ve seen it a million times before . \\nthere\\'s always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it\\'s the same story . \\nand sometimes , it works . \\nthe wedding singer works . \\nfirst of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective . \\nactually , it\\'s not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one\\'s own romantic tension . \\nsandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love . \\nbarrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with . \\nsparks don\\'t fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other . \\nsecond , their love is mature . \\nthey are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they\\'re a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material . \\ninstead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with . \\nat a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by . \\nthe repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child . \\nthe ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie . \\nother critics liked this movie in part because of the \\'80s soundtrack . \\ni liked it in spite of the soundtrack . \\noften , the music and references felt forced . \\nfor example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to \" get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up . \" \\n ( ha ha ha . \\nget it ? \\ndavid lee roth did leave van halen ! ) \\nor how about when sammy ( allen covert ) , robbie\\'s chauffeur friend , shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver glove . \\n ( that\\'s exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! ) . \\nunfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding . \\nthat\\'s not to say the movie isn\\'t funny . \\nscreenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination . \\nherlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight-faced , smart-aleck style . \\nlet\\'s hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over . \\nwith barrymore\\'s charm and sandler\\'s heart , it was hard to go wrong . \\n', b\"ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church \\nsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . \\nin a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . \\nto atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . \\nsoon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . \\nbut sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . \\nopinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . \\ni believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . \\nduvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . \\nincidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway . \\nsince no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . \\nin terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . \\nsimilarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . \\non the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience . \\nin terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . \\nteenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . \\nin other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience . \\n\", b'insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . \\nas the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . \\nthroughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute\\' indians that doesn\\'t seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . \\nparker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! \\nmusical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . \\napart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- \" south park \" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! \\nalso offers up some pretty decent laughs . \\nthe aforementioned `ute\\' indian tribe that packer\\'s group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . \\nstone\\'s humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt\\' or revealing what\\'s underneath his muff cap . \\njason mchugh\\'s character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . \\nas i mentioned before , parker\\'s songs are very catchy . \\nyou\\'ll be hard pressed to get `it\\'s a shpadoinkle day\\' out of your head once you\\'ve heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every \" south park \" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . \\nother songs you\\'ll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you\\' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper\\'s song\\' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard\\' ( the rousing finale ) . \\nthankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut\\'s songs are . \\nreleased as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . \\nthe videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . \\nthere are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . \\nas for the dvd . . . \\nwell , that\\'s a different story . \\nprobably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! \\nthe musical ! \\nthe dvd is a massive achievement . \\npresented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! \\nspecific extras . \\nthe first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i\\'ve ever seen on any disc . \\nthe picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . \\nadd to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt

director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley\\'s frankenstein . \\nkenneth branagh\\'s new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale . \\nthe dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful . \\nbut the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story . \\nhorror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror . \\nbranagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches . \\nhis version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel . \\nthe film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean . \\nthe year is 1794 . \\na bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters . \\nhis gole is to reach the north pole at all costs . \\nas the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon . \\nit\\'s a man . \\nexhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew . \\nhis name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown . \\nthe myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 . \\nhe is remembering his childhood and youth . \\nlaughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns . \\nhere victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony . \\nthis idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed . \\nlike thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother . \\nshocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death . \\nstanding on his mother\\'s grave he says : \" oh mother . . you \\ndid not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i \\nwill stop this . . i \\npromiss . . \" \\nafter proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career . \\nafter a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death . \\ncomposing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally . \\nwith strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation . \\nthe result was ugliness . \\nrealizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late . \\nthe creature has escaped . \\nbecause of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding . \\nfor a while everything is as it was before his mother\\'s death . \\nbut then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . . \\nwhale\\'s picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel . \\nbrannagh has more or less done that . \\nanother thing is characters and actors . \\nbranagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast . \\nthe greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro . \\nalone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness . \\nat first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love . \\nlater when he reads frankenstein\\'s journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge . \\nhe is capable of killing without regret . \\n \" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and \\nthen i slowly crushed his neck . . . and \\nas i killed him , i saw your face . . \" \\nthat is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator . \\nand yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : \" for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . \" \\nrarely has a cinematic interpretation of \" the daemon \" approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel . \\nanother vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein . \\nin most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm . \\nalmost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel . \\nhere , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene . \\nbranagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character . \\non the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past . \\nhelen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein\\'s surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart . \\nthe rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing . \\nvisually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) . \\nthe spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley\\'s frankenstein is a wonder to behold . \\nkenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : \" . . all \\ni once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by \\nmy hand . . \" . \\nand the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator\\'s body on fire . \\nthe film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness . \\nand a terrifying last close-up on the creature\\'s smiling face . \\ncan a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ? \\nto whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ? \\nshelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them . \\nfollowing her example , branagh does the same . \\nhis film is a tragic saga about playing god . \\nvictor frankenstein is not an evil man . \\nhe wanted to change the world to the better . \\nin this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions . \\nproduced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film \" dracula \" . \\nin comparison , i can say that \" dracula \" has visuals that even \" frankenstein \" can not live up to . \\nbut when it comes to story , characters and casting , \" frankenstein \" is stronger . \\nbut stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan\\'s \" interview with the vampire \" . \\nalthough the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . \\nbranagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly\\'s classic novel . \\n', b'charlie sheen stars as zane , a radio astronomer who listens for sounds from other lifeforms . \\nwhen he finally gets one , his boss destroys the tape and fires him . \\nnaturally , zane is not ready to give up , and he comes up with an ingenious way to do this himself . \\nhe is aided by a young neighborhood kid and they discover that the sound is coming from mexico . \\nso zane goes down there to investigate , and runs into a lady studying why the temperature of the earth has dangerously risen so suddenly . \\nzane is having marital problems at the time , and an offer by her to spend the night with him is very tempting . \\nhearing charlie sheen deliver the line , \" i guess there is something to be said for celibacy \" is the funniest thing i have ever heard in a movie since matthew broderick discussed asexual reproduction in wargames . \\nthis is just the setup , and i don\\'t want to give too much away , because a large part of the movies fun is the surprises . \\ncharlie sheen , who has had a rocky career as of late , is in top form here . \\nhe is funny , serious , and determined to accomplish his goal . \\nsheen\\'s absolutely terrific performance is another big plus to this movie . \\nthe story is ingeniously devised by twohy , who also wrote and directed the equally clever cable movie grand tour : disaster in time . \\nthe films major flaw is a very slow pace , and not much happens in the earlygoings . \\nviewers may be growing restless for a while , but trust me if you stick around and keep your head in it , you will have a good time . \\n', b'the previews for the movie are pretty good . \\nthey show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script . \\nunfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes . \\nthe residents of mystery love hockey . \\nmystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football . \\nthe townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who\\'s guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that\\'s one of the movie\\'s jokes . ) \\nevery saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch . \\nthe town\\'s prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated . \\nmystery\\'s national fame has the town abuzz . \\na week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl . \\nthe new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals . \\nthe mysterians see this as both good and bad . \\non the one hand , they\\'d love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition . \\non the other hand , they don\\'t want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes . \\nthe movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition . \\nbiebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement . \\nhe\\'s already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife . \\ncrowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he\\'s just kind of stuck with constantly brooding . \\ncharlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man\\'s worth . \\nhis \" gift \" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater . \\nhe hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him . \\nburt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans . \\nwalter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him . \\nhe wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it . \\nreynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together . \\none character actually was interesting . \\nbiebe\\'s wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey . \\nbut unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community . \\nshe chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open . \\nher unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom . \\nmysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning . \\nthe biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about . \\ninstead , roach and screenwriters david e . kelley and sean o\\'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy . \\nthey try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride . \\nthey present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there\\'s nothing truly funny . \\nthey show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about . \\nas columnist molly ivins would say , it\\'s all hat , no cattle . \\nthe perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about . \\nthere is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music . \\nit is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what\\'s truly important . \\nrussell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie\\'s metaphor for us . \\nhe says that what really matters in life is \" community . . . . \" \\nthen adds \" and hockey . \" \\ni guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear . \\nonly mildly bad , mystery , alaska probably deserves 2 stars . \\ni even laughed out loud , genuine laughs in places . \\nbut i docked it an extra half star when mike myers , a friend of roach , turned up in a role that didn\\'t suit him . \\nmyers is a comic character actor . \\nhe puts on masks , becomes an outrageous caricature , and is funny . \\nhe\\'s great as austin powers , dr . evil , or any of his scottish characters . \\nnobody else in mysterty , alaska is a comic caricature . \\nall the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles . \\nfor roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast , toward his audience , and indeed toward the film itself . \\nit\\'s an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously . \\n', b'that thing you do ! \\n ( r ) tom hanks\\'s screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice . \\nit is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this \\'60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . \\nthat thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , \" that thing you do ! \" \\nthe group\\'s members are , naturally a diverse group : there\\'s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film\\'s center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . \\nalong for the wonders\\' ride to success is jimmy\\'s perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . \\nhanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls \" the last innocent year . \" \\nthe spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it\\'s still playing in my mind as i write this ) . \\nit should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film\\'s biggest and best dramatic moment . \\nthe work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early \\'60s ; they do not appear to be \\'90s grungers playacting \" retro . \" \\nyet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it\\'s nearly nice to a fault . \\nwhile this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting . \\neveryone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note . \\nthere isn\\'t much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks\\'s turn as the wonders\\' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it\\'s bland . \\nbut a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there\\'s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it\\'s just about impossible to hate . \\nit\\'s an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , \" that thing you do ! \" --quite \\npossibly for days . \\nto paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play \" that thing you do ! \" \\n', b\"the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane . \\nbilly , played by michael keaton , is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble . \\nchristopher lloyd portrays henry , an obsessive-compulsive who requires that everything be neat , orderly , on schedule , and by the books . \\nhe thinks he's a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports . \\njack , played by peter boyle , thinks he's jesus . \\nand finally , there's stephen furst as albert , a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases . \\nthe dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four-some when their psychiatrist , dr . weitzman , takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium . \\nduring a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan . \\nthe movie's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast . \\nthe four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue , bicker , or insult one another . \\nhenry and jack , for example , fight over who's going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game . \\nthe actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other . \\nmichael keaton is well cast as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity . \\nas the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and fresh . \\nalthough stephen furst's catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing . \\nwhile keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special . \\nlloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance . \\nhis body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character . \\nlloyd's brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character . \\nthe dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise . \\nthe characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot . \\n\", b' \" i\\'d rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , \" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher . \\nwith that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story . \\nhe will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation . \\nfrom elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church . \\nwell , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion . \\ninstead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god . \\nand arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments . \\ninstead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures . \\nwhen in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss \" sonny \" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson\\'s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves\\'s most powerful scene . \\nthe body of the story starts with sonny\\'s coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters . \\nwith his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident\\'s dying victims . \\nthe scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord\\'s work . \\nrobert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film\\'s director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier . \\nrarely has a movie been such a labor of love . \\nwith a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher . \\nduvall has every movement down pat . \\neven when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy . \\nhe dances and claps all the way . \\nsonny\\'s churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive . \\n \" i may be on the devil\\'s hit-list , but i\\'m on god\\'s mailing list , \" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent . \\nand they lap it up . \\npeople jump up , scream , \" praise the lord ! \" \\nand mean it . \\nthe intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . \\nbut sonny is no saint . \\nit turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett . \\njessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church\\'s youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny\\'s church , leaving him unemployed . \\nsonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever . \\nthe bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( \" one way road to heaven : holiness temple \" ) with an enthusiastic flock . \\nin this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church . \\nhe asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money . \\nand his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks . \\na man who can\\'t stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , \" i quit school because i didn\\'t like recess . \" \\nin his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn\\'t seen in a while . \\nhis romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn\\'t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . \\nbilly bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker . \\nhis confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show\\'s many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . \\nalthough it probably couldn\\'t have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . \\nand don\\'t miss the sweet epilogue during the film\\'s closing credits . \\na tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . \\nthe apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 . \\nit is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up . \\n', b'it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters . \\nthis year\\'s crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997\\'s lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world . \\nthe marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( \" heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd . . . \" ) , which doesn\\'t make me optimistic about future summers . \\ngodzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations . \\nthat this big-budget remake won\\'t rise above its roots is fairly obvious . \\nthe credits show us the origin of godzilla . \\nin five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard . \\nsounds like an enquirer headline , doesn\\'t it ? \\nthe mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable \" discovery \" sequence . \\nthis time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain\\'t a stereotype . . . ) \\nwhen he discovers the telltale radar blip . \\npeople die . \\ncut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick . \\nhe makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to \" singin\\' in the rain . \" \\nit\\'s a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie . \\nno dice , bueller . \\nfrom the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla\\'s enormous footprint . \\nevery disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it . \\nas the world\\'s leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn\\'t you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , \\nbroderick is invaluable to the government . \\nhe immediately dispels vicki lewis\\' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can\\'t take seriously the intellectual arguments of \" newsradio \" cast members . \\nbroderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard . \\n \" the radiation isn\\'t an anamoly , \" he announces , and lightning strikes . \\n \" i believe this is a mutated abberation , \" he continues , and lightning strikes again . \\nit\\'s vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more . \\nmeanwhile , we\\'re introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick\\'s former love . \\ngee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ? \\npoor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer . \\nitalian cameraman hank azaria tells her she\\'s not ruthless enough : \" nice doesn\\'t get you anywhere in this town . \\nit\\'s dog eat dog . \" \\nactually , it\\'s lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple\\'s core . \\nthe filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla . \\n \" i think i\\'ve got a bite , \" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him . \\nyou can guess what happens next . \\nsimilar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city . \\nhearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , \" please don\\'t tell me that\\'s another parade . \" \\nplease don\\'t tell me that\\'s the best line you could come up with . \\nmayor ebert is not pleased . \\nplayed by the principal from \" head of the class , \" he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene . \\ni guess the filmmakers knew they\\'d be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn\\'t even bother to kiss ass . \\nthe problem is , if you\\'re going to attack siskel and ebert , you should at least make it funny . \\ndialogue like , \" didn\\'t we agree that we weren\\'t going to have any sweets until after the election ? \" \\nfollowed by , \" back off , gene , \" just doesn\\'t work for me . \\nother lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character\\'s last name and frenchman jean reno\\'s inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york . \\nthere\\'s even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses . \\nas the beast heads back into hiding , broderick suggests the military lure it out with food . \\ncue twelve dump trucks , all dropping fish into a new york intersection . \\n ( broderick : that\\'s a lot of fish . ) \\nthat ambush fails , but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them . \\nyep , godzilla\\'s with children , which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla . \\nthat\\'s until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually , like linda tripp . \\ngodzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day , so it has a lot of dumb action scenes , destructive special effects and shallow subplots . \\nlook no further than patillo\\'s betrayal of broderick ( patillo : what have i done , animal ? \\nwhat have i become ? ) and the climactic \" godzilla\\'s nest \" sequence in madison square garden . \\nthe main difference is , independence day was about the experience . \\nit had a real global , patriotic element to it , and some genuinely fun characters . \\ngodzilla has lots of rain and lightning , reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak , blockbuster , juicy fruit , swatch , sprint and bumble bee tuna . \\nyes , bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla . \\nthat fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie . \\n', b'if anything , \" stigmata \" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another . \\nof the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . \\ni suppose i should have seen this coming . \\nafter all , \" blair witch \" thoroughly creeped me out , \" sixth sense \" was mildly spooky , and then \" stir of echoes \" had its moments , but wasn\\'t anything i\\'d lose sleep over . \\nclearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . \\nis it then any surprise that \" stigmata \" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? \\nno , not really . \\npatricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother . \\nas it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest . \\nthe priest\\'s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . \\nfather kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . \\nhis investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . \\nfather kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie\\' s story , considering she\\'s an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . \\nhe eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . \\nas it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a \" fifth gospel \" before they were excommunicated . \\nthe new rupert wainwright music video . \\n . \\n . \\ni mean film \" stigmata \" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . \\nindeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it\\'s only interesting for about five minutes . \\ni\\'m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . \\nhis camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing . \\nwhat this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , \" see ? \\nlook at what i can do ! \\ni\\'m an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . \" \\nmaybe then he\\'d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . \\nif there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn\\'t see it . \\njust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . \\narrrrrrrghhhh . \\n . \\n . \\nthen again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn\\'t bother me if \" stigmata \" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . \\nthough wainwright\\'s vanity certainly doesn\\'t help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . \\nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? \\ncase in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren\\'t given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . \\nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she\\'s kind of cute , so let\\'s start the bleeding ! \\nthe fact that she\\'s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn\\'t help , either . \\naccording to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? \\ngo clubbing ! \\nsure , that makes sense . \\narquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . \\nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . \\neven though frankie page\\'s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . \\neven more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . \\nfather andrew\\'s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . \\nas for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i\\'ll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . \\ntrust me , i\\'m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . \\nwhat\\'s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . \\nfirst of all , the film doesn\\'t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \\nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \\nactually , i\\'m not sure what frankie was posessed by . \\nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \\nwhich one is it ? \\nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \\nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \\nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you\\'ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \\nthere\\'s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \\n \" stigmata\\'s \" religion is so off-base that it can\\'t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \\nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \\ni\\'m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\'t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . \\nit\\' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \\ni\\'m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \\nmaybe it\\'s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \\nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \\nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \\nso much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film\\'s ( many ) flaws . \\ni\\'m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \\nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \\nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it . \\n', b'plot : a rich guy who doesn\\'t believe in love , orders a mail-order bride for himself . \\nthat very evening , the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter . \\nbut what\\'s this ? \\none of them might not be the person they are pretending to be ? \\nwow . . . a \\nsin , indeed . \\ncritique : easily one of the worst movies that i\\'ve seen all year . \\ntoo long , too boring , too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie . \\nwhat the hell were they thinking when they made this thing ? \\n ( it\\'s no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience . \\nhave you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn\\'t help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn\\'t part of some sick joke ? \\nwell , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn\\'t a joke , it isn\\'t on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! ! \\ni say again . . . what the shite were they thinking ? \\nokay , so where do i start ? \\nfirst of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie\\'s main plot twist , the betrayal . \\nso for the first half hour of the film , you\\'re basically just sitting there , watching these two \" lovers \" go through the motions until the \" betrayal \" occurs . \\nwhoopee , big surprise . \\nsecond of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part . \\nwhy ? \\nwell , it\\'s like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman ! \\ni mean , it\\'s like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here . \\nevery look in jolie\\'s eyes screams \" psycho \" ! \\nthen of course , you have the case of the \" patsy \" husband , a man who just can\\'t seem to figure out anything in time . \\ni mean . . . how \\nboring is that for the audience ? \\nyou\\'re watching this guy screw up time after time after time , and somehow , we\\'re supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude . \\nno , thanks ! \\nand if we don\\'t care about him , and we really don\\'t care about her ( she\\'s a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film ) , who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film ? \\nwell , i\\'ll tell you . \\nthe only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i\\'d actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled . \\nno suspense , no chemistry between the leads , no real love or passion , no sense of surprise , plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending . \\nso why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ? \\nwell , it\\'s actually pretty simple . \\ni liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score , but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie\\'s boobies ( that\\'s two points right there ! ) and another one for antonio\\'s ass ( hairless , just for the record ) . \\neverything else in this movie was pointless , boring and just plain stupid . \\ntry imagining a soft-porn movie . . . but \\nwithout the plot ! \\nthat\\'s pretty much what you\\'ve got here . \\na low point in the careers of both stars . \\noops , i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue . . . god \\noh mighty . . . make \\nit stop ! ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\namerican psycho ( 9/10 ) - cruel intentions ( 8/10 ) - eyes wide shut ( 6/10 ) - fatal attraction ( 8/10 ) - playing by heart ( 7/10 ) - under suspicion ( 7/10 ) - what lies beneath ( 8/10 ) - what women want ( 4/10 ) - whipped ( 7/10 ) \\n', b\"i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . \\ntake the professional , for example . \\nit boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . \\nit's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . \\nthe professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . \\nthe professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . \\none day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . \\nher name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . \\nagent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off . \\nleon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . \\nthe two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . \\nwriter/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . \\nthere is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . \\nbut beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . \\nthe relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . \\nleon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . \\njean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . \\nnatalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . \\nbesson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . \\na silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . \\ngary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . \\nthere isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . \\na more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . \\nthere were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . \\nbut besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . \\nthis is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . \\na great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . \\n\", b'bad movies described as \" a swift descent into sinful pleasure , decay , and debauchery \" are hard to watch . \\nbad 2000\\'s movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch . \\nshadow hours falls into the latter category , a mish-mashed train wreck of b-movie actors ( including michael dorn , aka star trek\\'s worf ) , an uninteresting plot , vain attempts at capitalizing on the \" underground \" scenes of seedy los angeles , and really , really bad directing and horrendous music video-esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out . \\nthe film revolves around the life of michael holloway ( balthazar getty ) who is trying to restart his life with his one-dimensional wife chloe ( rebecca gayheart ) after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions . \\nmichael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l . a . one night , he meets a strange gent named stuart ( mr . buckaroo banzai , peter weller ) . \\nhe drives a porsche , smokes french cigarettes , and drones on about life , eventually coaxing mike into exploring the \" underbelly \" of l . a . together , a tour of punk bars , s&m clubs , and bare-knuckle fights . \\nthe film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene , acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask 2 . the film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip-off of dante\\'s inferno mixed with an old stephen j . cannell television pilot . \\nthe pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus . \\nother horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the charlie sheen , johnny depp , richard grieco-esque acting of balthazar getty . \\npeter weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and doesn\\'t give two shits about it . \\nand after the cheap exploitation of bondage clubs , dance clubs , and brothels - damn , isn\\'t anyone safe any more from the ugly eye of hollywood ! ? \\nway back in 1984 , a great but crazy director named abel ferrara made his worse film and called it fear city . \\nshadow hours reminds me of an almost perfect sequel . \\ndirector/writer : isaac eaton producers : peter alevey , andrea mia , shon greenblatt , balthazar getty starring : balthazar getty , peter weller , rebecca gayheart , peter greene , frederic forrest , brad douriff , michael dorn \\n', b\"as the film opens up , expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her baby's father in a fast food drive-through window . \\nafter he gets his milkshake , he drives off , only to be pursued by a military helicopter . \\nfrom this moment forward , you know that this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy . \\nhome fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson ) , a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally . . . more \\nthan he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sally's unborn child ) . \\nafter taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her , he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works , and the fun goes on from there . \\nthis movie is a lot of fun . \\nit is comedic on two levels , as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy . \\nthe romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy . \\none of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes . \\nhowever , the dark comedic moments are more memorable . \\nthis is also a tale of revenge , and a funny one at that . \\nthe father of sally's unborn child also happened to be a married man , whose wife is played by catherine o'hara . \\nshe does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair , and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work . \\n ( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away ) . \\nrounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian's overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian's trainer at the fast food restaurant . \\nthe dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot . \\nif there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore's performance . \\nwhile she does light up the screen , there are moments when she doesn't seem all that convincing . \\nthe movie was filmed in texas , and most of the characters have southern texan accents . \\ndrew barrymore's accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn't seem to have this problem ) . \\nas well , she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant . \\nstill , this movie is one that will please many viewers . \\nwith plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments , this is sure to entertain . \\n\", b'sam ( matthew broderick ) is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda ( kelly preston ) . \\nhe is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton ( tch ? ky karyo ) comes as a complete surprise to him . \\nbut as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back . \\nhe moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton\\'s apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them . \\nsuddenly anton\\'s ex maggie shows up , but she does not want her former lover back . \\non the contrary , all she wants to do is vaporize him . \\nshe may say that she doesn\\'t want to kill him , but the possibility doesn\\'t bother her too much either . \\nafter all , people die every day . \\nin spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on . \\nthe story sounds like something we all have seen a million times . \\nbut we haven\\'t . \\ngriffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since \" while you where sleeping \" . \\nthe camera obscura adds a \" special something \" to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy . \\neverything about the movie is perfect , from set design to casting . \\nthe dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite . \\nmeg ryan , known from \" when harry met sally \" or \" sleepless in seattle \" , surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image . \\nshe impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl . \\neven more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her , much more so than in last years \" courage under fire \" where she played a gulf war pilot . \\nmatthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality . \\nthe viewer can tell that he doesn\\'t only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them . \\nhe has trouble keeping in touch with reality . \\nafter all , who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love ? \\nhis naivet ? that we don\\'t question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge . \\nshe would do anything to harm anton . \\nshe doesn\\'t hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them . \\nthat makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed , have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier . \\ntch ? ky karyo is perfect as anton . \\nhe is , well , repulsive . \\nthat\\'s all there is to say about him . \\nyou can\\'t really manage to pity him , even after all his mishaps . \\nhe not only took sam\\'s bride away from him , he is also a french chef . \\nworlds collide , i . \\ne . \\nthe usa and france . \\nthis can only go wrong . \\neven if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking , you just can\\'t sympathize with a man who plays \" je t\\'aime . . . moi \\nnon plus \" on his tape deck . \\nnot everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for . \\nsam certainly isn\\'t . \\ntoo bad for anton . \\nfor him things take a turn to the worse . \\n \" addicted to love \" is one of this year\\'s most pleasant surprises . \\n', b'miramax \" disinvited \" on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 . \\nthey ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film\\'s february 4th release date-unsound reasoning . \\nyou see , \\'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain\\'t it cool news . \\nno , the ? mini major\\' was afraid we\\'d let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise . \\nsomething smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney\\'s mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car . \\n ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , \" 100% cotton \" , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture . ) \\nof course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream\\'s unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ? \\nthe backseat ? \\nthe next car ? \\nthrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton\\'s girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering . \\nwhat\\'s missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3\\'s remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff . \\nour other surviving regulars have become estranged . \\nsidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2\\'s movie-within-a-movie , \" stab 3 \" , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program . \\nmurder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of \" stab 3 \" , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney\\'s death . \\nthe appeal of ghostface\\'s villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people . \\nscream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive . \\nironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there\\'s at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume . \\nwith scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface\\'s ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent . \\nconceptually . the execution of ghostface\\'s master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we\\'d come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying \" all bets are off ! \" \\nin reference to the \" rules \" of a trilogy\\'s third act , but there\\'s a difference between rule breaking and cheating . \\nwith the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of \" stab 3 \" ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven . \\ncraven\\'s direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects . \\nhow else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny . \\nit pains me to write this , but scream 3\\'s comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven\\'s music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) . \\nthe visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming\\'s camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before . \\n ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) \\nfinally , marco beltrami\\'s music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it\\'s mostly silent . \\nsting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score . \\ni look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . \\nthe film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint\\' . \\n', b' \" goodbye , lover \" sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why . \\nit\\'s a mess . \\nand that\\'s * way * before ellen degeneres shows up . \\nthe film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters . \\ni suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment . \\ni didn\\'t laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) . \\ndegeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair . \\neither degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn\\'t yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist . \\nevery single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid . \\nher reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is \" at least she died healthy . \" \\nand that\\'s one of her wittier asides . \\ndegeneres\\' sgt . \\nrita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait . \\nto give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses . \\nit\\'s best described this way : \\nsultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a \" creative yet unfocused \" ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney . \\nsandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake\\'s brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help . \\nben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his . \\nthe film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again . \\nalthough there are some genuine surprises , the plot twists get too contrived too quickly . \\nprobably around the time degeneres\\' gumcracking gumshoe appears . \\nat least the former \" ellen \" star is going for something a little different . \\narquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : \" lost highway , \" \" true romance \" ) while quoting embarrassing lines like \" i\\'m not wearing any underwear . \" \\ni hope she got paid a lot of money to do this . \\nhere\\'s an example of some of the film\\'s flat-out stupidity . \\nsandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film\\'s duplicitous lovers . \\nshe drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite \" the sound of music \" on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims . \\nso what was the point of the wig and the car ? \\n \" the sound of music \" stuff might be a reference to \" the wizard of oz \" allusions in david lynch\\'s \" wild at heart , \" but if so joff ? must have forgotten that \" wild at heart \" was a despicable movie . \\nit\\'s hard to believe that \" goodbye , lover \" was directed by the same person who made \" the killing fields \" and \" the mission . \" \\nit\\'s not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long . \\nit should have stayed there . \\n', b\"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) \\ndirected by robert altman \\nsome time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . \\nthe novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . \\nthe only problem : the novel wasn't very good . \\nit was far more pulp than pulitzer . \\nbut the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . \\nso he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . \\nthe director ? \\nfrancis ford coppola . \\nthe book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather . \\nthe rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . \\nby bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . \\nbut the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . \\ncan you get any more questionable than john grisham ? \\ndepends on whom you ask . \\nbut there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . \\nlike puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . \\nso something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . \\nthe result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . \\n>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . \\nthis terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . \\nwitness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . \\nwe roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . \\nright away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . \\npay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . \\nthis is what a great director can do for questionable source material . \\nthe sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . \\nmagruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . \\noutside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . \\ndriven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . \\nthere he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . \\nher car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . \\nmagruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . \\nthis simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . \\nhe succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . \\nbut then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . \\nthe cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . \\nhis only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . \\nif this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . \\naltman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . \\nan accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . \\nis his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? \\nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . \\nas the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . \\nand life is never so bad that it can't get worse . \\nif you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . \\ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . \\ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . \\ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . \\nand of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . \\nthanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . \\nand now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . \\nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . \\nis it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? \\nyou be the judge . \\nbut back to the picture at hand . \\nin the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . \\nin the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . \\nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . \\nbut there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . \\nthat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . \\nthey probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . \\nand that , my friends , should make you very afraid . \\n\", b'there\\'s a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . \\ni\\'d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . \\nthe early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . \\ndeep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . \\nthe repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there\\'s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation\\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \\nthen we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . \\nthe mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there\\'s a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation\\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \\nit goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . \\nhow do we know this ? \\nbecause we\\'ve seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that \" the comet is still headed right for us \" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . \\nladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . \\nsuccessful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . \\ntelevision is what\\'s wrong with deep impact . \\nthe main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that\\'s the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . \\nshe thinks it\\'s an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . \\nwhen she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . \\n \" i know you\\'re just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . \" \\nshe figures out what\\'s really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet . \\nupon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question . \\nand everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you\\'re a star . \\nleoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet\\'s collision course with earth . \\nand i\\'m sure it\\'s comforting for her to know that , even though the world\\'s ending in a matter of months , she\\'s a cable news personality . \\nso there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up . \\nsuch personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process . \\nbut as anyone who\\'s seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail . \\nthey only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth . \\nyeah , thanks , nasa . \\nthat\\'s when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren\\'t picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years . \\nthey even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave . \\nif the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie . \\ninstead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town . \\nthe reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . \\nand , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks . \\ni\\'m sure it\\'s comforting to know that , even though the world\\'s ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives . \\n', b'a big house . \\na big director , jan de bont of speed and twister fame . \\na big star , catherine zeta-jones , hot of the heels of entrapment ( 6 . 5/10 ) and zorro . \\na big remake of the haunting . \\nand big special effects . \\nso what do they all amount to ? \\nunfortunately for us , a big bore ! \\nplot : a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old , spooky mansion for controlled testing . \\nunbeknownst to the patients , the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear . \\ncritique : this movie just didn\\'t scare me one bit . \\nsure , it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there , but on the whole , it took waaaaay too long to get going , provided very little meat in the plot , went way past its own bedtime , and basically relied on grunts , the muttering of children\\'s voices and over-the-top special effects , to scare us . \\nwell , this film didn\\'t do much for me . \\nand they might as well have called it the \" haunting of lily taylor \" , since she\\'s basically the only character who had any real depth , background or reason to be in the house in the first place . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong , catherine zeta was sweet window dressing ( despite my continued perception of her faint mustache-see entrapment ) , and owen wilson was good as the standard \" comic relief \" , but come on people , if you\\'re going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks , how \\'bout giving them a little more than one-liners as dimension . \\nneeson was also wasted as the smart , british guy . \\nit\\'s all too sad , cause certainly the \" idea \" seemed like a good one ( see the shining ( 9/10 ) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry ) , but the story was thin , the conclusion was laughable ( be gone . . . poof ! ) and the special effects ? \\nwell , they sure were nice to look at , but not for a moment did one of them scare , or even for a split-second , have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry . \\nsee it for zeta-jones , or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going , and provide very little payback , otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld , the shining . \\nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : goofy actor owen wilson co-scripted indie favorites rushmore ( 8/10 ) and bottle rocket with director wes anderson . \\nhis brother luke wilson is also an actor , who once dated drew barrymore for a year or so . \\nbrother andrew is also an actor . \\nsinger lisa loeb is listed in the credits as having portrayed the character of olivia morice , but i personally did not notice her . \\nshe is well known for her number one single \" stay ( i missed you ) \" and goofy glasses . \\nthe creaks and moans heard throughout the house were prerecorded and played during filming in order to get a more natural expression of fear out of the actors . \\ncatherine zeta-jones is currently dating flabby ass actor michael \" sex is my life \" douglas . \\nshe stands 5\\'8 \" . \\nin 1998 , actor michael rapaport pleaded guilty to the aggravated harassment of lily taylor . \\nhe was ordered to stay away from her and undergo counseling for one year . \\nactor bruce dern , who plays the throwaway role of the gatekeeper in this film , was once nominated for an oscar for best supporting actor for his role in coming home . \\ndirector jan de bont was born in holland , and began his lengthy career as a cinematographer on films as die hard , hunt for red october and basic instinct , directed by another dutchman , paul verhoeven . \\nactor todd field also played a small but pivotal role in stanley kubrick\\'s last film , eyes wide shut . \\nhe was nick nightingale , the pianist . \\nthis film was originally titled the haunting of hill house . \\n', b\"okay , okay . \\nmaybe i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it wasn't as good as the others . \\nhowewer , the latest segal picture didn't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash . \\nboy , was i wrong ! \\nin the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal's acting , ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes . \\nby the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers . \\nnot once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense . \\nof course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest . \\nin these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie . \\noh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other . \\ni have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie . \\noften , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing . \\nhow many movies have psycho ex-special forces bad guys ? \\ntoo many . \\ni was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . . \\nsimply said , this is movie-making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience . \\nmy recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch . \\nyou'll be looking at it for most of the movie . \\nmy . \\nrent die hard . \\nread a book . \\nstare at the sky . \\ndo not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid . \\nthe real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again , dragged in by my friends , which by the way , liked the movie halfheartedly . \\nthey probably like wrestling too : - ) . \\n\", b'how many of us would become strippers ? \\nfor those of us who wouldn\\'t , is it a moral reason , or purely a lack of confidence ? \\nthat\\'s probably not a fair question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons . \\nas you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . \\nwould you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? \\nin case you haven\\'t guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ain\\'t . \\nit\\'s actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication . \\nit is the story of six out-of-work , out-of-shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not without need . \\nwhat to do ? \\nit hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . \\nit seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . \\neventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance . \\nthese include the overweight , confidence-lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly-officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant . \\nwhen the sextet is complete , we\\'re given a hefty dose of physical comedy . \\nwe watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . \\nas if there anti-appeal wasn\\'t enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising \" the full monty \" on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all . \\n . \\n . \\nand i mean * all * . \\nthe movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add . \\nit\\'s sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater . \\nwith the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel-good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way . \\nthe amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film . \\nthere\\'s a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast couldn\\'t be better . \\neach character is completely individual , interesting , funny , and most importantly , real . \\nthe full monty is never offensive , a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could\\'ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness . \\nit\\'s one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment , perfect for a great night on the town , or as a saturday night movie rental . \\neither way you see it , it shouldn\\'t let you down in the slightest . \\nand , pun heavily intended , when it\\'s all said and done , you\\'ll be smiling from cheek to cheek . \\n', b'trekkies , roger nygard\\'s energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions . \\nthe beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike . \\n ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . ) \\nthe good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe . \\ndenise crosby , who played tasha yar on \" star trek : the next generation , \" serves as the host . \\nin the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) . \\n ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the \" new yorker \" as the first recorded usage of the word . ) \\nunless you\\'ve been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans . \\none pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate . \\nothers talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of . \\nmy personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams . \\narguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do . \\nher claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well . \\n \" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , \" she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession . \\nshe doesn\\'t quite understand all of the uproar . \\n \" i\\'m an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , \" she reminds us . \\nher fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith . \\nalong with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty . \\nand their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment . \\nfew other avocations could give this much satisfaction . \\nthese people are having the time of their lives . \\n ( for the record , i\\'m not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . ) \\nthe film interviews the various star trek series\\'s stars as well as its fans . \\nthe stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong . \\nfilled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions . \\nat one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel . \\nafter appearing briefly , he drank some water and left . \\nthey decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the \" q virus . \" \\nthe guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too . \\nwith dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity . \\nnot just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies . \\none guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist . \\nthe dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set . \\nhe , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time . \\nit appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family . \\nfor variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time . \\nhe says his patients like it . \\nwell , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway . \\nthere are summer schools for klingon with ph . d . linguists to teach the language . \\nhamlet is now available in klingon , albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore , and they are working on translating the bible . \\nthey even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs , even u . s . customs . \\nthe movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series\\'s larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns . \\nsandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn\\'t work . \\nthe incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator . \\nhe fits right in . \\ntrekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 . \\nit is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages . \\n', b'well , i\\'ll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante\\'s peak ) i could just smell what \\'twister\\' had started . \\nso now it seems that we\\'re in a full fledged return to the \\'70\\'s disaster film era . \\nwith \\'twister\\' , \\'dante\\'s peak\\' , \\'volcano\\' and soon \\'flood\\' and james cameron\\'s extremly expensive \\'titanic\\' \\ni\\'ll say first off i enjoyed \\'volcano\\' much more than i did \\'dantes peak\\' . \\npart of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in . \\ni\\'ve been reading a lot about the movie being \\'cheezy\\' or \\'hokey\\' and really didn\\'t see or think that once during the entire film . \\ni get bored easily and this film didn\\'t bore me for a minute . \\nanother thing , and boy am i bitching today ! , that bothers me is when critics and such go on about \" well thats not really possible . \" \\nyou know what ? \\ni couldn\\'t give a bloody damn if it\\'s possible or not , really i couldn\\'t . \\nit\\'s a freaking movie and i don\\'t want reality thrown in my face . \\ni want to be able to see the impossible , the all might \" what if \" to many reviewers have seen one to many movies ! \\nthe special effects are the second star to this feature . \\nthey are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground . \\nthey did an incredible job and come oscar time ( if they remember ) some notice better be thrown there way . \\n', b'porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty-five years . \\nthey and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , \" town and country . \" \\n \" town and country \" has a pedigree befitting it\\'s title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( \" the graduate \" ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( \" funny bones \" ) . \\nafter years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty\\'s next \" ishtar . \" \\nso , is it that bad ? \\nthe answer is no . \\nbut it\\'s not very good either . \\nthe major problem with \" town and country \" is that it\\'s unstructured and random . \\nstoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) . \\nnext scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin . \\nthen mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples\\' divorce lawyer ) . \\nellie thinks she\\'s overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family\\'s mississippi manse . \\nthe two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they\\'d never become a couple to begin with . \\nback home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter\\'s cheating on her . \\nporter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he\\'s gay . \\nthe four friends , along with every woman porter\\'s dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after . \\nalthough the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere . \\nthe stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , \" the virgin suicides \" and tricia vessey , \" kiss the girls \" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who\\'s just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home . \\nafter an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son . \\nporter\\'s romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled . \\nonce the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm . \\nwhile beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused . \\nmaybe we\\'re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn\\'t initiate his own sex romps ? \\nkeaton\\'s ellie has a trusting nature that\\'s a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character . \\nhawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of \" the out of towners \" and \" the first wives\\' club \" while shandling\\'s relegated to true second banana status . \\nkinski is bland and unmotivated . \\nandie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay\\'s most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair-bound , foul-mouthed mother . \\nheston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party . \\noscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like \" hear my song \" and \" funny bones . \" \\nthe script is this film\\'s weakest link - it\\'s telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old-fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit . \\nwhile \" town and country \" isn\\'t exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there . \\n', b'to sum the entire film \" 54 \" up in one sentence , it would be : watch a vh1 documentary instead . \\n \" 54 \" , seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 , brought him into studio 54 , got him really drunk , told him to write about it , and then dumbed that down to be released to the public . \\na sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex , drugs , and disco . \\nthe narrator , shane o\\'shae ( ryan phillippe ) , works as a grease monkey in new jersey who , of course , on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio \"

politics . \\nit\\'s actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story . \\nall of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . \\nwe\\'ve seen it all before , and we\\'re just not blown away with it like we should be . \\noh well . \\nit\\'s still an excellent irish story . \\n \" the boxer \" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . \\nfirst off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . \\nwhile this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle\\'s \" shallow grave \" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . \\ndanny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . \\nand danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( \" breaking the waves \" \\'s emily watson ) , who hasn\\'t seen him since he went in . \\nthey don\\'t easily start up their romance again because she\\'s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny\\'s tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . \\nbut the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . \\nthe political story is nothing really special but works in itself . \\nwe\\'ve seen it many a time before , but it\\'s at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . \\nthere\\'s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . \\nthe boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . \\nthere are only a few boxing scenes , but they\\'re never like \" raging bull \" /let\\'s-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant . \\nthey\\'re more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . \\nand i didn\\'t know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape . \\nbut the backbone of the story is the love one . \\nbecause these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . \\nas the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . \\nthis is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . \\nthese elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother . \\ni loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . \\nit made sure that we didn\\'t just care for one of them . \\ni\\'m not saying they\\'re all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . \\nthe acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . \\ni\\'m not sure if they\\'re oscar-nominee bound , but they\\'re very good . \\nin the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . \\nbut the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . \\nthe direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . \\ni noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . \\nmore time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . \\nthough \" the boxer \" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . \\nsure , it\\'s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it\\'s own , it just could have been better . \\nbut it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . \\neven if it could have been better , this\\'ll do . \\n', b'this is an adaptation of h . g . wells\\' acclaimed novel \\'the invisible man\\' . \\nthe actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue . \\nthe director is paul verhoven . \\nthat , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre . \\nthe problem is to keep us there . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time . \\nworking on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself \" god \" , has discovered the secret to invisibility . \\nthe first two faces are completed . \\nnow , it is time for \" the next logical step \" -- human . \\ncaine volunteers for this risky experiment . \\nbut when he is made invisible , something goes wrong . \\nwhile his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower . \\nbut that\\'s not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania . \\nhe is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine . \\nsoon every sense of decency is forgotten . \\nthe little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody . \\nthough it\\'s based on a novel called \\'the invisible man\\' , the title has been ironically changed to \\'hollow man\\' that sums up the film very nicely . \\nthis is a very silly production . \\nlaughable , actually . \\napparently verhoven\\'s imagination doesn\\'t stretch too far . \\nfor him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls\\' locker room undetected . \\nit is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie . \\nbeing invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society . \\nin many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences . \\nthe nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about . \\nall that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat . \\ncaine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man . \\nbut since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn\\'t stop there . \\nhe becomes a rapist . \\nand then , of course , a murderer . \\nyou\\'ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place . \\nshue\\'s talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent . \\nkevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully . \\nhis face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice . \\nthere are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing . \\nin the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place . \\nbeing probably the best technical achievement since \" jurassic park \" , they are absolutely amazing . \\nwe observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible . \\nwe see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood . \\nthere are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? \\nwhat is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . \\npretty much like jan de bont ( \" twister \" , \" haunting \" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . \\nhe was responsible for several good films ( \" basic instinct \" and \" starship troopers ) \" and some incredibly bad films ( \" showgirls \" , \" total recall \" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . \\nin a way \" hollow man \" fits perfectly in this collection . \\nit\\'s not better or worse than verhoven\\'s average film . \\nhe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . \\nand so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot\\'s of dull action with blood and naked bodies . \\nhe even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you\\'ll be screaming \" nooooo ! \" \\nand attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) . \\nand all we can ask is why ? \\nthe answer is simple . \\nthough hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . \\nit has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . \\nit has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . \\nto make us care , to make us think and feel . \\nverhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . \\nit\\'s all flesh and bones , but no soul . \\na void where its imagination should be . \\n', b'[note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh\\'s hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap . \\nas it happens , it didn\\'t take long . ] \\nis there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ? \\nknown mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968\\'s romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria . \\nlast year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature . \\nit might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen . \\nat first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance . \\nthe hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused . \\nthe ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery . \\nthe plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus . \\nit is zeffirelli\\'s genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace . \\nin this italian master\\'s hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son\\'s worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea . \\nafter all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ? \\nwhat seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then-reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead . \\nwho could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a \" lethal weapon \" ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ? \\nfranco zeffirelli , that\\'s who . \\nand it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money . \\nwhat gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible . \\nhis line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed . \\nhis movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character . \\nthis is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film\\'s end . \\nglenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet\\'s mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i\\'m still trying to understand the character as written . \\n ( zeffirelli\\'s incestuous interpretation of hamlet\\'s relationship with his mother doesn\\'t help . ) \\nalan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy . \\nby and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably . \\nof special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone . \\nboth support the realistic mood marvelously ( as do the sets and costumes ) , without any overstated effects that declare \" this is important ; this is shakespeare ! \" \\ni particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all : the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due . \\nperhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare \" definitive . \" \\nand there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen . \\nbut if you\\'ve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard , this hamlet is an excellent place to start . \\n', b\"one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site . \\nprofessors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . \\nanna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! \\narthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . \\nmother-in-law jokes prevail . \\nfurthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . \\nfred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . \\nhowever , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . \\nthe story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock in store for daphne . \\nthe partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . \\nthis is what binds the movie together . \\njoan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast . \\non the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen ! \\neven though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors . \\nalthough the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film . \\na relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition . \\n\", b'the first in a very long list of things wrong with \" i still know what you did last summer \" is the title . \\nthink about it for a second . \\nif the last movie was called \" i know what you did last summer \" , wouldn\\'t the next movie have to be \" i still know what you did two summers ago \" ? \\nif anyone working on this movie had an i . q . \\ngreater than five would have thought about it logically and said , \" hey . . . \\nwait a minute \" . \\nbut alas , the people behind this film are obviously idiots , so i won\\'t hold them to that . \\nwhat i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands , even for a teenage slasher flick . \\ni guess i\\'m one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the \" kind of \" ) . \\nit wasn\\'t great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good , but at least it didn\\'t have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it\\'s sequel did . \\nthere are just so many problems with this movie that it\\'s hard trying to figure out where to start . \\nfirst of all , i guess , is the setting . \\nthe movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas , other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting . \\nexactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james ( jennifer love hewitt , one of the only survivors of the first film ) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up ? \\nthe movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through . \\nin one scene , julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can\\'t get out , no matter how hard she tries . \\nwhen julie discovers she\\'s going to slowly fry to death , she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue . \\nnow , this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth , why not just turn the freakin\\' thing off ? \\nin another scene , one of the characters , after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker , says to julie , \" just don\\'t tell anybody it rained the whole time . \" \\noh yeah , i\\'ve just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered , but hey , i\\'ll crack jokes anyway . \\nafter all , it is in the script . \\nthe film\\'s only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the \" re-animator himself , jeffrey combs . \\nhe brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie . \\nway to go , jeffrey . \\ni have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it\\'s head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson . \\nwith \" scream \" and even it\\'s sequel , he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter . \\nhis ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers , and i think \" i still know \" has really suffered by not having him on board . \\nthe cool atmosphere is still there this time around , but i just didn\\'t like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one . \\neven though the movie doesn\\'t have williamson , it still has a hacky ending , trying to do what kevin did with the first two \" scream \" s by ( some may consider this a spoiler , but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever , then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes ) having two killers and , this time , having one of them being a family member to the other . \\ni think someone in the audience put it best when , after the movie had ended with another \" the killer is back ! \" \\ncliffhanger , he said \" who is this time , the grandma ? \" \\nall in all , \" i still know \" tries to be as successful as the first the film was , but really fails in the attempt . \\ni mean , it\\'s okay when slasher movies rip-off each other , but when they start copying themselves . . . \\n', b'when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . \\nwhile i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don\\'t think that they are completely to blame for this movie\\'s failure . \\nit appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the \" unseen \" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . \\nso special effects or not , if the story isn\\'t the least bit scary , you aren\\'t going to end up with a very frightening movie . \\nthe thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . \\ndern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . \\nas i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern\\'s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . \\nnever a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . \\nliam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . \\nhe decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . \\nhe tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . \\nand he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . \\ncatherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . \\nlike the original , taylor\\'s character is the star of the movie . \\nbut since she doesn\\'t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . \\nand let\\'s face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . \\ni\\'ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren\\'t in it . \\nbut the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . \\nthey take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . \\nthere really isn\\'t much of a story here . \\njust endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . \\nand the special effects are great . \\nin many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . \\nin other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the \" cool shots \" quota . \\nat no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . \\nbut not scary . \\nthen we have the set . \\nwhen i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . \\nbut it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . \\nthis included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . \\nwhat part did these rooms play in the story ? \\nabsolutely none . \\nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . \\nthen we have the actors . \\nlili taylor has never been one of my favorites . \\nand when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . \\ni have no idea why liam neeson took this role . \\nhe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . \\nhis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . \\ni have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . \\nzeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . \\nthe fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . \\nall catherine has to do in this movie is look good . \\nfortunately that is something she does very well . \\nwhile she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . \\nit\\'s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . \\nany random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . \\nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999\\'s horror movies , the blair witch project . \\nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . \\nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . \\nif the story sucks , it\\'s all downhill from there . \\nmy advice ? \\nif you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars . \\nif it\\'s scares you want , rent halloween . \\neither way , it\\'s probably in your best interests to skip the haunting . \\n', b\"capsule : five friends at a stag party are involved in the accidental killing of a prostitute . \\nthe cover-up attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends , two wives and several innocent bystanders . \\nthis was a real audience pleaser at toronto , but it did not do much for me . \\n , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \\n- directed by peter berg who acted in the last seduction and copland . \\n- five buddies go on a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding to one of them . \\none of the buddies accidentally kills a prostitute . \\n- several people with no moral compass . \\nthey started out with a simple , innocent little cocaine party ( ! ) and by accident look what happened . \\nthey have one moral person among them ( daniel stern ) , and one totally amoral person ( christian slater ) . \\nit is more selfish to let the amoral lead , so they do . \\n- this film is strange , but not really funny or biting . \\nblack comedy should actually be funny as well as strange . \\nthere should be some element of satire . \\nthe satire is missing here . \\ni did not find myself laughing here either . \\nwhat we have is a strange crime tale . \\n- one just does not care what happens to these people . \\n- the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently . \\nif this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation . \\n- it begins like diner ( particularly with daniel stern ) and ends up like an extended horror/crime comic book . \\n- there are several logical holes in script . \\nif a security man goes to investigate a complaint and disappears , wouldn't the guests he was investigating be the first suspects ? \\nsomeone framed for a crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work . \\n ( i am desperately trying to avoid making this a spoiler . ) \\n- popular and situation ethics get a real slamming . \\n- some acting of grief is hammy and overdone . \\nmore yelling than humor . \\n\", b'brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie ,

for long , and once the big \\'secret\\' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end . \\nalthough there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at

fernando vallejo \\nstarring bob flanagan and sheree rose . \\ninterviews by kathe burkhart , kirby dick and rita valencia . \\nproduced and directed by kirby dick . \\nrunning time : 90 mins . \\nthis film is not rated . \\nthe central themes of \" sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist \" are pain and love , and its subsequent effect on a person\\'s life . \\nits protagonist , bob flanagan , who died at the age of 52 , suffered from cystic fibrosis , a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus , preventing him from normal breathing . \\nthe movie is about much more than recouperating ( or attempting to ) from this disease . \\nan audacious , fabulously triumphant docudrama , \" sick \" chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious , unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years , sheree rose , who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film . \\nflanagan\\'s idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental , similar to terry zwigoff\\'s brilliant 1994 \" crumb \" , which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait , but a realistic one . \\nboth crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects . \\nbut flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs , he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age , courageously defying god ( he was an irish catholic ) and turning his body into a work of art , which he unraveled in museums and lectures . \\nbehold these works of physical art . \\namong them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus , and , --the most disturbing scene of the decade-- , nailing his penis to a board . \\nflanagan was a man of great intelligence , wit and humor , as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking . \\nnot only did he approach his disease with humor , peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience , he was also revitalized by his approachment . \\nmost with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties ( there\\'s also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her . \\n ) \\nbut the most outstanding thing about \" sick \" is flanagan\\'s relationship with sheree . \\nbrimming with honesty , sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain , their powerful bond lifts \" sick \" into a rare cinematic high , where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people . \\nthe last scene , where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed , as he struggles for his last moments of life , is raw , tender , hideous . \\nit goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy . \\n', b\"50's `aliens vs . \\nearth' idea revamped ! \\nif you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 . \\nit promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . \\nid4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . \\nthe premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era . \\nthe movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked . \\nthe aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth . \\nthe us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities . \\ncapt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot-shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc . \\nhis squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie . \\nid4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses . \\nacting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) . \\nno prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious . \\nid4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen . \\nif i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens . \\nhowever below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion . \\nan idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous . \\nid4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company . \\nsome of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18's and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi . \\nid4 is a movie for all . \\nthough there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it . \\nsit back and don't be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was . \\nif you are not planning to watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one . \\nthis film is best watched on the big-screen . \\n\", b\"is evil dead ii a bad movie ? \\nit's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release . \\nexplaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult . \\n`well what's it about ? ' \\n`five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . ' \\n`come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week . \\nwhy should i see it again ? ' \\n`no evil dead ii is different , it's funny . ' \\n`it's funny to see people die ? \\nare you sick or something ? ' \\nmaybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie . \\nhis unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious . \\nan example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound . \\nsure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet . \\nthe whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster . \\nthe more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes . \\nno matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes . \\nand raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand . \\nlike the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part . \\nbut it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family . \\nall of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny . \\nraimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off . \\nwith a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . \\nending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel . \\n\", b'the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients : a witty and whimsical script , inspired performances , a great sense of humor , a large and wonderful cast , and the beautiful scenery of vancouver . \\nit\\'s a movie of weddings , marriage , family , infidelity , and--oh yes--love . \\nlike 3 men and a baby , cousins is an americanized version of a french film : 1975\\'s cousin , cousine . \\nthe plot is complicated , but it goes something like this . \\nlarry and tom are cousins , each of whom is not-so-happily-married . \\ntom starts an affair with larry\\'s wife , tish , and to get even , larry and tom\\'s wife , maria , pretend to have an affair of their own . \\nsoon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running . \\ncousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures . \\nthe acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role , and virtually every performance deserves mention . \\nted danson ( in his first starring film role ) finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity . \\nwhile larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on \" cheers , \" he is also complex and vulnerable , with more between his ears than empty space . \\nas maria , isabella rossellini is a joy to watch ; she is shy , sensuous , and immensely alluring . \\nsean young is perfectly cast as larry\\'s picture perfect wife , tish , a superficial and trendy make-up consultant . \\nkeith coogan , from adventures in babysitting , is wonderfully weird and eccentric as larry\\'s rebellious son , mitch . \\nand finally , lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitch\\'s rambunctious grandfather ; he provides some of cousins\\' best lines and laughs . \\nlike moonstruck , cousins is a mix of drama and comedy . \\nthe film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd . \\nit understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and heart-tug . \\nhow often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other , as friends and as lovers ? \\nwell , to its credit , cousins is just such a movie . \\nlet\\'s hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins \\n', b'ingredients : james bond , scuba scene , car controlled by cellular telephone \\nsynopsis : warped media tycoon elliot carver ( jonathan pryce ) plots to start a war between britain and china in order to boost ratings by using a \\'stealth ship\\' to fire a captured british missile at the city of beijing . \\nsuper-agent james bond ( pierce brosnan ) uses trick gadgets , pluck , and charm in order to foil carver\\'s scheme . \\nthis time bond teams up with top female agent wai lin from china ( michelle yeoh ) . \\nthe film contains fights , chases , gadgets , and comedic moments . \\nopinion : it does not have a casino scene or a ski scene , but tomorrow never dies is nevertheless a solid , enjoyable bond movie . \\nit neither stands out nor disappoints . \\nin old bond movies bond sometimes teamed up with american cia agent felix leiter . \\ntomorrow never dies introduces a new character in the form of chinese agent wai lin . \\nlike leiter\\'s character , wai lin would be a sure bet for a cameo in a later bond movie . \\nstars : michelle yeoh was born a leo in the western zodiac in the year of the tiger on the asian astrology calendar . \\ni don\\x12t believe in horoscopes . \\nbut at an airport i once browsed an astrology book with a section on leo tigers ( lts ) . \\n \" leo tigers prefer enough solitude to grow at their own pace . \\nlts are unbelievably courageous when facing adversity . \\nthe lt is also classy , and has an excellent sense of refinement , but she sees herself as an adventurer , and prefers freedom of movement rather than flashy status symbols . \\nthis person loves family and friends with a fierce loyalty . \\nshe delights in siblings , nephews , nieces and extended family - - but she must have her personal freedom to come and go as she pleases . \\nsometimes annoyance at injustice drives her to take up one or two causes . \\nin love life , the lt has an unfortunate mental block against committing to any partner who is less powerful than she . \" \\nin real life , michelle yeoh is asia\\'s top female star . \\nlike jackie chan , she does her own stunts . \\nshe was born in malaysia - - a country of many languages - - and her primary language ( the language she speaks in her sleep ) is english . \\nshe was taught malay in school , and learned cantonese from bilingual parents . \\nas an athlete michelle represented malaysia internationally . \\nshe enjoyed squash , diving , swimming , and rugby . \\nshe studied ballet at the royal academy of dance in london , but switched to drama after a spinal injury . \\nin 1983 she won the miss malaysia pageant - - without really intending to , since a family member had entered her in the contest without her knowledge . \\nnotoriety from the contest led eventually to a movie career as an action heroine . \\nmichelle has survived a divorce with asian retail tycoon dickson poon ; a nearly fatal stunt accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital for three months , and ; a retirement from the movies . \\nher comeback from retirement , supercop ( 1992 ) became the top grossing film in asia that year . \\nit is not clear what michelle\\x12s martial arts style is , but it may be a theatrical version of wing chun . \\nof her character wai lin in tomorrow never dies , michelle says , \" wai lin is the first bond girl who is on a par with bond , someone who can match up with him mentally and physically . \" \\nmy own opinion is that casting michelle yeoh as agent wai lin was an excellent choice . \\n', b\"damn those trailers . \\nhad it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand' . \\nas it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair . \\nmarie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach . \\nshe takes a nap while he goes for a swim . \\nwhen marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found . \\nshe contacts authorities , but they can't find him either . \\ndid he disappear to start a new life ? \\nwas he killed by accident ? \\ndid he commit suicide ? \\nmarie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers . \\nit's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit . \\nthe film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing . \\nit's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles . \\nthis is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling . \\nrampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she's delusional . \\nthe scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking . \\nshe can't quite get over him . \\nthey've been married for twenty-five years . \\nthe other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too . \\nthe sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon's `criminal lovers' , it's the disney channel . \\nlikely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand' is a fine movie going experience . \\nwhile it's hard to recommend as entertainment , it's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss . \\nozon seems to ask what you would do , and that's certainly a hard question to answer . \\n\", b\"starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that . \\njunior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman . \\nthese are the same men that brought us the very funny twins . \\nso foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins . \\nso much for hopes . \\nschwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy . \\nunfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding . \\nstill believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse . \\nso , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug . \\ntheir theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman . \\ndoes the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? \\nwell , it must have to the producers of junior . \\nadmittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off . \\nperhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny . \\nbut it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best . \\nthe sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny . \\nschwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics . \\ni kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture . \\nbetter yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ? \\nanything would have been better than this mess . \\ndanny devito is wasted in this movie . \\nhis part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street . \\n ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . ) \\nemma thompson is wasted here as well . \\nwhile thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian . \\ntoo bad she didn't get to use any of that talent here . \\nam i being too hard on this film ? \\ni don't think so . \\nschwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood . \\nwith a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film . \\nthey certainly managed here . \\nmaybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made . \\nif you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito's comedic talents . \\n\", b'robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style . \\noverwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) . \\nso when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it\\'s in trouble . \\njakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically \" uplifting \" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn\\'t realize it . \\nwilliams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii . \\none night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment . \\njakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast . \\nthe announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant \" heil hitler ! \" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob\\'s ghetto . \\nliberation ! he thinks . \\nthe next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along . \\nsoon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death . \\nthis is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate . \\nthe danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger . \\nin a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home . \\napparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear . \\nhe and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning . \\nthe moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine . \\nbut jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false . \\nsuch hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren\\'t met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope . \\nthat\\'s the film\\'s biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false . \\nit\\'s never moving because it doesn\\'t give us anything to be moved by . \\njakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing . \\nrobin williams doesn\\'t inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent . \\nhe is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless . \\nnot since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn\\'t the robin williams we know and love . \\nin good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it . \\nhere , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor . \\njakob the liar will be compared with last year\\'s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a \" holocaust comedy \" . \\nit\\'s not a comedy . \\nit tries , sometimes , but it rarely works . \\nis it a melodrama ? \\na war movie ? \\na character study ? \\nno , no , and no . \\njakob the liar is the kind of movie that can\\'t be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts . \\n', b' * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling\\'s latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once . \\nwhen she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it\\'s impossible to tell whether she\\'s being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically . \\nsuch is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button . \\nthis fear of drama soured me on fast times . . . , look who\\'s talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu . \\nhas anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari\\'s dora ? \\nattired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger . \\nthe mechanics of loser\\'s tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes . \\nthey become walking wardrobes . \\nsmall-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter\\'s cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn\\'t scream \" shemp \" ( the lame stooge ) wig louder . \\nhe has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam . \\nthough they\\'re not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her . \\n ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged . \\ndora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions . \\nunfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . ) \\nwhen paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) . \\nalthough paul\\'s already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott . \\nshe\\'s thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul\\'s to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( \" cabaret \" ) , and just when paul\\'s got in his head that she\\'s starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott\\'s live-in girlfriend . \\ncue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er . . . \\n ( aside : simon & garfunkel\\'s \" parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme \" should never have been allowed in another motion picture . ) \\nheckerling has a lot in common with nora \" you\\'ve got mail \" ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong-willed women . \\nmen continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she\\'s cheerily redecorating his apartment . \\n ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . ) \\ngoth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them . \\nheckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling\\'s social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes . \\n ( consider , too , that dora is the film\\'s sole female principal . ) \\nnot that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn\\'t . \\nthat is her hallmark . \\n ( --- for more first-run , dvd , and books-about-movies reviews , plus contests and the proverbial \" more ! \" , \\nvisit

whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking . \\nthe thin red line is flawed but it provokes . \\nterence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . \\nunlike this year's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . \\nwhile that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . \\nsaving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . \\none message is not necessarily more correct than the other . \\nit just depends on one's point of view . \\nin malick's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll's cinematography is beyond lush . \\nthe setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? \\nin saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . \\nin the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . \\nthey are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . \\nall that separates them is war . \\nthe flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs . \\nunbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do

effective comedy/mystery . \\nwhile the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . \\nthe story begins in

stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon . \\nupon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and

found myself having some free time , i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see \" mafia ! \" , a spoof of mafia and crime films such as \" the godfather , \" \" goodfellas \" and \" casino \" . \\nat 84 minutes in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep . \\nbut by my account , i think that my laff-o-meter only registered a few grins , one giggle , and maybe one chortle . \\ni suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star , lloyd bridges , who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film . \\n \" mafia ! \" \\nchronicles vincenzo cortino\\'s ( lloyd bridges ) life . \\nseparated from his family when he was young , he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life . \\nbut as fate would have it , vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord . \\nfollowing in his footsteps are his two sons , joey ( billy burke ) and anthony ( jay mohr ) . \\nlike all siblings in powerful crime families , they squabble over power , the future of the family , fortune , and women . \\n \" mafia ! \" is co-written by jim abrahams , who also contributed to some gut-busting funny spoofs such as \" airplane \" and \" the naked gun . \" \\nbut these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work . \\nas i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based . \\ncrime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence . \\nit\\'s a tough genre to parody . \\ni was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies , maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say \" please \" as they decide which sector to take over , but this opportunity was never explored . \\nthere were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter-in-law . \\na gunman shoots him several times . \\nthe impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena . \\ni think that i just gave away the best part of the film . \\noh well , that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier . \\n', b'for a movie about disco-era excess , \" 54 \" comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club . \\nthink of it as a sort of \" boogie nights \" -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , \" 54 \" leaves the kinkier details to your imagination . \\nit never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either . \\nin fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , \" 54 \" would be about as feathery as the time period\\'s popular female hairstyle . \\nstudio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 . \\ninside , anything went and , we are told , everything did . \\nthe film\\'s fictional main character is shane o\\'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club\\'s velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines . \\nhis wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in \\'79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course . \\nonce inside , shane becomes seduced by the club\\'s dizzying vortex of sex and drugs . \\nhe has such a good time that he doesn\\'t want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy . \\nhe quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg\\'s a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own . \\nafter rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 . \\nbut fame doesn\\'t come without a price . \\n \" 54 \" \\'s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act . \\nalleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since \" 54 \" sometimes feels like it\\'s missing a scene here or there . \\nnowhere is this more apparent than in shane\\'s relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he\\'s long admired from afar . \\nthe romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special . \\nthat \" 54 \" works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it\\'s assembled . \\nsure , it\\'s shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we\\'ve seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision . \\nthe film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( \" the wedding singer \" \\'s ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54\\'s closed doors and asks for a \" funky little treat . \" \\nthe solid , sexy cast smooths out - if only while you\\'re caught up in the film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot . \\nnewcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat ; he and campbell , as fetching as ever , look so good together it\\'s a shame their subplot goes nowhere . \\nmeyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in \" clueless \" ( he was the stoner with the joker-smile ) , while hayek simply sizzles , especially when leading a dance class with the mantra , \" one , two , three , attitude ! \" \\nsherry stringfield , unidentifiable under big \\'70s hair , takes on her first big-screen gig since she left \" er \" as rubell\\'s accountant , but she\\'s criminally underused . \\nas the droopy-eyed , drug-addled steve rubell , myers is worth the price of admission alone . \\nwhen he\\'s not playing the life of the party , the ex- \" saturday night live \" comedian strips away all of rubell\\'s confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty , unhappy life with exorbitance ; it\\'s a moment worthy of pity when , while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening , he attempts to seduce one of his employees . \\nand while his performance is largely serious , myers mixes the empathy with a delicate \" austin powers \" -esque wink , thus keeping consistent with \" 54 \" \\'s overall feel - gaudy , larger-than-life and satisfyingly ornamental , not unlike a giant disco ball . \\n', b' \" you leave little notes on my pillow . \\ni told you a million times i can\\'t stand little notes on my pillow . \\n\\'we are all out of corn flakes - f . u . \\' \\nit took me three hours to figure out that \\'f . u . \\' was felix unger . \" \\n--- a frustrated oscar madison ( walter matthau ) running down a list of his complaints against his roommate felix unger ( jack lemmon ) , in the odd couple . \\nthe classic neil simon comedy ( based on his own stage play ) about suicidal felix ( lemmon ) , who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar ( matthau ) to stay with him in his apartment after felix\\'s wife throws him out and files for divorce . \\nthe hook : oscar is messy and likes his apartment that way , while felix is an obsessive/compulsive neat freak . \\nthe two men , despite their friendship , instantly clash . \\nmovies just aren\\'t as delightfully funny as this one is . \\nevery line of neil simon\\'s dialogue flows like comedic poetry , and all the actors are just perfect in their performances . \\nlemmon is at his best as the anxiety ridden felix , but it\\'s matthau who shines brightest as oscar , whose world is being invaded and rearranged , mostly against his wishes ( the type of character i always enjoy identifying with ) . \\nand who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti ? \\nthe best thing about the film ( and this is a testament to the quality of the writing ) is that it\\'s a comedy with substance . \\nthese two men , even while at each other\\'s throats , genuinely care for one another as friends . \\nwhen they clash , it isn\\'t cartoonish hatred being displayed , but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends but just cannot manage to co-exist . \\nmovies nowadays , take grumpy old men for example , just don\\'t have that extra spark there . \\nthese days it\\'s just animosity for the sake of comedy . \\na television series followed ( starring jack klugman and tony randall ) , which i\\'ll admit i\\'ve never seen an episode of in its entirety , and neil simon even scripted the sequel , the odd couple ii , which was released in 1998 . \\nneither of them compare to this comic masterpiece though . \\nit\\'s one of the best comedies of all time and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films . \\n', b'you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they\\'re as real as life . \\ni once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person\\'s brain with microwaves . \\nthen i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . \\ni even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted . \\nthese people had what are known as \" conspiracy theories \" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . \\na little imagination goes a long way . \\nin richard donner\\'s conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . \\nhis latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day\\'s work for him . \\nhe combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . \\nupstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . \\nlucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . \\nwhat she doesn\\'t know is that jerry\\'s interest in her is far more than , well , professional . \\nhe goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . \\nbut when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry\\'s ideas and his limited-circulation \" conspiracy theory \" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice\\'s help . \\none of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . \\npart of this is a result of the film\\'s slow pace . \\nit takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . \\nat over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it\\'s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . \\ninstead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we\\'re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite \" black elements \" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . \\nthey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . \\nbig deal , we\\'ve seen it all before . \\nwatching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . \\nnow , when i say it took forever to set up the \" relationship \" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . \\noh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . \\nyou see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . \\nthe two just don\\'t click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he\\'s been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . \\nthe script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . \\ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . \\neven gibson\\'s usual gift for ad lib couldn\\'t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry\\'s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . \\nunfortunately , much of what\\'s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what\\'s going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it\\'s never followed through . \\nfor example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . \\nhe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man\\'s lungs for chlorine . \\nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . \\nyou know what happens then ? \\nnothing , zip , nada . \\nno follow-up whatsoever , so what\\'s the significance ? \\nokay , here\\'s another one . \\na couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel \" the catcher in the rye \" . \\njerry also has a bunch of copies . \\nwhenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . \\nleaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we\\'re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . \\nnot when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . \\nthe point becomes totally extraneous . \\noh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? \\nyeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . \\nthat\\'s about it . \\nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he\\'s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . \\nyou can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . \\nthis guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . \\nokay , here\\'s my theory . \\nthis really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! \\nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over . \\n', b\"imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long , excruciating cross-country car trips , far from the city and into the deserted rural routes . \\nso far , the trip is idyllic when , abruptly , your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere . \\nit is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness . \\nit is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption . \\nthe plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the vanishing . \\nkurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job . \\nwhen they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department . \\nminutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops . \\njeff cannot detect the car's problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j . \\nt walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner . \\nit is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor . \\njeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight . \\ndisconcerted , the coffee shop's bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here . \\nthere , trouble arises . \\nand i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what's head . \\nthere are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam . \\nit is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff . \\nkurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses . \\nso you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect . \\nsuffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one . \\nnot many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them . \\nas an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes . \\nalthough the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with . \\nfaced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is . \\nwhat's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow . \\nmostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair . \\ncontrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance . \\nafter breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety . \\nthe villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective . \\nthe baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder . \\nthe movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies . \\nworth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for . \\nalfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man's biggest fears . \\nbreakdown yields exactly that . \\nit magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man , acting like an ordinary man , looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero . \\ndespite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock , i think , would approve of breakdown . \\n ( 1 : 33 ) \\n\", b\"deserves recognition for : making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 \\ncapsule review : this is what feel-good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90's : an hour-and-a-half commercial , disguised as an unnecessary remake , in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass . \\n ( between this , rocketman , and george of the jungle , disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film . ) \\nas the absent-minded professor who invents the titular computer-generated goop , a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly . \\nthe only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly-founded but firm belief that writer/producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he's used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series . \\ntake your kids to see boogie nights instead . \\n\", b' \" soldier \" , by director paul anderson , is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting . \\nthe best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel\\'s character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision . \\nbrutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it , and the opening scenes tap into it a little . \\nthen it goes nowhere with that idea . \\nthere is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization , and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i\\'ve ever seen . \\nthe whole idea of the inhuman , soldier-type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done , and it\\'s been done much better . \\ni was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story , which wouldn\\'t be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting . \\nbetween the action sequences , it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr . russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes , since his dialog is extremely limited . \\nhis performance in that way isn\\'t all that bad , but certainly is not enough to carry this film . \\nother performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all , and they generally are about as weak as their characters . \\nbut enough of this stuff about plot and character , right ? \\nisn\\'t the most important part of an action film , well , the action ? \\neven in this aspect the film is a disappointment . \\nin mortal kombat ( 1995 ) , director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining . \\nhowever , he fails to repeat that in this film . \\nthe combat scenes , particularly the big one at the end , is incredibly unimaginatve . \\nfighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie , a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize . \\nbut instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with , it goes for the old , shoot-em up , one guy vs . an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s . \\nif the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously , it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film . \\nhowever , it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that , making the film a big disappointment . \\n', b'in \" gia \" , angelina jolie plays the titular character , the first so-called supermodel . \\nand right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes , anyway ) . \\ni just don\\'t see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film . \\ndespite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie . \\nsadly , though , my fears were realized . \\nit\\'s just not possible to make an interesting , full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes . \\nthe movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) , a tumultuous woman who doesn\\'t particularly enjoy the world of fashion . \\nshe becomes famous more quickly than she can handle , and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have . \\nthe last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high , losing a job , and going into rehab . \\nthis formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it . \\nin general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use . \\nno because it offends me or anything like that ; it just bores me . \\nquite frankly , i don\\'t see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices , i am left somewhat unimpressed . \\nthe first hour of the film , though , was actually quite engaging . \\nwe see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend . \\nthese early scenes were interesting . \\nwe\\'re shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn\\'t seen before . \\nthe movie begins to go downhill , however , once gia becomes an established model . \\n>from that point , i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end . \\nit all seemed so excessive . \\nfine , so gia had a drug problem , does this really need to dominate the film ? \\ncouldn\\'t the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs ? \\nor perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world . \\nquite possibly , although since i have no desire to become a model , this warning is lost on me . \\nas i stated at the beginning of this review , i simply don\\'t see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature-length motion picture . \\nwhat do they do that warrants a movie ? \\nstrut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ? \\ni suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players , for example , but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life . \\ngia did not . \\nand by the end of the film , all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling , was bi-sexual , and was heavily into drugs . \\nnot exactly a meaningful contribution to society , as far as i\\'m concerned . \\n', b'my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . \\ni love ralph fiennes . \\ni love uma thurman . \\ni love sean connery . \\nhell , i\\'m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . \\ni saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i\\'ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . \\na few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . \\nthen , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . \\nand that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . \\nand that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . \\nmy expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . \\nthe film i saw today didn\\'t even meet those expectations . \\nthis is a lousy , incoherent mess . \\ni would slam it harder , if it weren\\'t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . \\nbut sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . \\nthat\\'s the main problem with the avengers : for all it\\'s hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . \\nit\\'s like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . \\nit also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . \\nthis is just plain depressing . \\nthe avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . \\nfrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i\\'ve never watched an episode . \\ni wasn\\'t alive then . \\ni don\\'t even watch television now . \\ni\\'m very sorry that i don\\'t have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i\\'ve already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . \\ni didn\\'t know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . \\ni also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . \\nbased on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . \\nthey are to work together , under mother\\'s orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . \\nit seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . \\nhis name is de wynter ( connery ) . \\nhe is a crazy scottish guy . \\nour heroes had better stop him , or else . \\n . \\n . \\nthe weather will keep getting colder until they \" have to go to hell to warm up \" ( one of the film\\'s few funny lines ) . \\nalong the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . \\nfor example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . \\nnow , killer bugs don\\'t really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . \\nthe purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . \\nthey\\'re never even directly connected to de wynter ( they\\'re controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . \\nthe special effects aren\\'t bad , but they\\'re loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . \\nlike so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . \\nand i guarantee you , it will wane . \\ni stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn\\'t do any good to think . \\nthe avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn\\'t tell us what happens . \\nthere are several scenes in the preview that didn\\'t make the final cut . \\nin addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . \\nthe scenes that don\\'t feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . \\nthey aren\\'t . \\nthe action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . \\nthey aren\\'t , either . \\nand what about this wasted cast ? \\noh , it makes me weep with disappointment . \\nwe\\'re talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . \\ni love the guy . \\ni\\'ve loved all his films , until this one . \\nhe seems like he wants to understand the film , but he\\'s as lost as we are . \\nand thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can\\'t manage to look at home here . \\n ( i don\\'t blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can\\'t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) \\nconnery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . \\nwho is to blame ? \\nis it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? \\nperhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . \\nis it the actors ? \\nfor god\\'s sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . \\ni blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn\\'t have been given the task to begin with . \\nhis best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . \\nadd to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . \\nif the avengers has a saving grace , it\\'s the set design . \\nthe sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . \\ni like the final set-piece , on de wynter\\'s island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . \\ni admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . \\ni also enjoyed michael kamen\\'s music score , particularly in the opening credits . \\nbut this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there\\'s a lot more that needs to be here . \\ninspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . \\nmaybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . \\nor a sense of purpose . \\nmost of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . \\ndamn this movie for not giving them the chance . \\n', b\"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . \\ni've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . \\nas it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . \\nit's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . \\nnorton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . \\nhe plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . \\nthe film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . \\nwe find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . \\nin the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . \\nmuch of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . \\nwhen derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . \\nwhat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . \\nit's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . \\nbecause american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \\ni partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . \\nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \\nit's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \\nof course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \\nit's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \\nin addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \\neven when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \\nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \\nthe other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . \\nvisually , the film is very powerful . \\nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \\nbut , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \\nalthough the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \\nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \\nit makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \\nperhaps this last scene was the problem . \\nit's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \\n\", b'we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer\\'s character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an \" a . \" \\nthat\\'s fair enough . \\nall movies , like all school children , should be given the benefit of the doubt . \\nthe chance to succeed . \\nafter all , we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders . \\nmountains can be moved , and good movies can be made . \\nyeah right . \\nchildren fail , as do films . \\nas does director john boorman\\'s latest . \\nthe success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ( ed wood , true romance ) as the busty westerner-in-peril wandering about 1988 burma without a passport . \\nthough we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there , it\\'s a tougher task to overlook the actress . \\nshe\\'s a lightweight . \\nas the first scene ( with narration ! ) \\ndemonstrates , she doesn\\'t have * nearly * enough range for the emotions that her character--a mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and son--is supposed to show . \\nshe may give a stronger performance than , say , keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds , by not by much . \\nbeyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film , thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman ( deliverance , excalibur , hope and glory ) . \\nhe keeps the narrative moving , no matter how muddy the story--or the heroine--gets . \\nwhy he chose arquette remains a mystery , though . \\nmaybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies . \\nbut even after an hour of half-stated political statements and murky mass killings , we * still * don\\'t know enough of what\\'s happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations . \\nempty exoticism . \\nthe technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix , combining lush jungle photography with bad blue-screen work . \\nalso odd is the obvious dubbing . \\ndone to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign ? \\nand , is it my mistake , or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers ? ? \\ndoo doo doo doo . \\n[ \" twilight zone \" theme , or opinion of movie . \\nyou be the judge . ] \\n', b'although i had not been a viewer of the \" rugrats \" television series , i went into their first animated feature film , \" the rugrats movie , \" with a positive attitude . \\nthe trailer looked cute enough , after all . \\nafter seeing it , i think the words in my recent \" antz \" review , in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995\\'s \" the pebble and the penguin , \" were a bit premature . \\n \" the rugrats movie , \" is bottom-of-the-barrel children\\'s fare at its worst , and starts to make , \" antz \" look good in comparison . \\nas in the show , \" the rugrats movie , \" is about a group of very little friends , ranging from babies to a three-year-old . \\nthe head of the group , tommy pickles ( e . g . \\ndaily ) , becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill ( get it ? \\ndill pickles ? . . . hardee-har-har ! ) and is informed by his three-year-old cousin , anjelica ( cheryl chase ) , that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children . \\nwhen the other children , chuckie , and twins lil and phil , suggest taking dill back to the hospital , tommy goes along with it , but on their way there , they crash in the forest , and become lost , running into wolves and circus monkeys , among other things . \\n \" the rugrats movie , \" judging from the idea of being lost in the woods , could have been a potentially fun family film , and there were many different things that could have been done with the story . \\nso what did the writers choose to do ? \\nwhy , they set up a protracted , cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall , of course ! \\nfor the youngest of children ( ages 3-7 ) , \" the rugrats movie , \" may very well entertain them , judging from the audience i saw this with . \\nof course , if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents , they were all desperately struggling to stay awake , and that included me . \\nfor an adult , \" the rugrats movie , \" is a piece of garbage . \\nthe plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm . \\nthere isn\\'t one laugh to be had in the film , nor is there any excitement . \\nif anything is even marginally good in the picture , it is the bright animation style , so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn\\'t to service a more quality film . \\n \" the rugrats movie \" is doa from the start . \\ni am all for a worthwhile family movie , but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful . \\nas said before , young children may like it , but even they deserve better than this . \\nfor adults , it is a nearly unbearable , excruciating chore to sit through . \\nas for me , \" the rugrats movie , \" is not the worst of the year , nor is it the most deeply hated , but it is the most boring . \\nparents : do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of , \" the wizard of oz . \" \\nthat is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder , two things of which , \" the rugrats movie , \" is completely missing . \\n', b'there\\'s only one presidential election every four years , but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as _the_ thriller of the year . \\nin 1997 , we\\'ve had absolute power , air force one , shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600 . \\nthis one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford , trying to bring us a complex plot of cover-up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys . \\nhere\\'s what happens this time . \\nit\\'s night at the white house . \\na secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt . \\nthe next day she\\'s dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in . \\nhow do we know he\\'s a hotshot ? \\nwe\\'ve seen the traditional action flick opener -- the clever hostage negotiation scene . \\nit\\'s not so clever this time , consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex-government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street . \\nsnipes is off to the white house , where he finds the secret service head ( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali ) won\\'t cooperate with him at all . \\nin fact , if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda , snipes wouldn\\'t have been allowed in the white house at all . \\nalda helps snipes out further , assigning a sexy secret service agent ( diane lane ) to act as his liaison . . . \\na very dangerous liaison . \\nwell , not really , i just wanted to say that . \\nalmost immediately , a suspect is found , an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos . \\nsnipes doesn\\'t buy it , and launches into an independent investigation of his own , one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president\\'s son . \\nsnipes\\' partner , an always- wisecracking dennis miller , calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane , who at first doesn\\'t believe snipes , eventually and predictably comes around , and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information . \\nfor the first hour or so , murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting . \\nsure , we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that , but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon . \\nsnipes and lane don\\'t make for a bad action team , but with nothing to work with , they\\'re just cogs in the bad movie machine . \\ndennis miller might as well not even be in the movie ; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood , and that\\'s saying a lot . \\nwhen you get to the last half-hour , the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer , busting out the old break-into-the-building underground climax . \\nand when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why , you\\'ll wish you never sat through this movie at all . \\nthe \" 1600 \" in the movie\\'s title doesn\\'t represent an address , it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide . \\nserving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century ! \\n', b'for the first reel of girls town , you just can\\'t get over lili taylor . \\nis it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ? \\nharder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ? \\nwith the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster . \\nit\\'s a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you\\'ve forgiven taylor her own maturity . \\nfor all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood . \\nthe movie\\'s opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis ) . \\nbut about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life . \\nthe remaining girls manage to smug nikki\\'s diary out of her grieving mother\\'s home , and page through it at patti\\'s place , investigating the root of nikki\\'s despair . \\nwhat they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen . \\nshell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives . \\nemma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player . \\npatti\\'s barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock\\'s car . \\nand anyway , patti\\'s had her own share of guys who wouldn\\'t take no for an answer . \\npained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it . \\n \" why do we put up with it ? \" \\nemma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch . \\n \" we try to talk about it , and look what happens . \\nwe fight for 20 minutes . \" \\nthere\\'s the admirable crux of this picture . \\ngirls town is a political film , in that it calls for action . \\nbut it\\'s incomplete-it\\'s never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take . \\nthe trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it\\'s surely one of this year\\'s most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock\\'s car ( doing the right thing ? ) . \\nthey hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall . \\n \" subvert the patriarchy , \" emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to . \\nthe girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti\\'s child , and eventually come face-to-face with nikki\\'s tormentor . \\nstill , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying . \\n ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it . ) \\nperhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( \" who you callin\\' a bitch ? \" ) . \\nthe points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary . \\nlong on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self-congratulatory for my own taste . \\ndirector jim mckay is best known as a consort of r . e . m . \\'s \\nmichael stipe ( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band ) , and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking . \\nthe movie was created and scripted by committee , but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when , predictably , the group couldn\\'t secure funding . \\nthen again , girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film . \\nthe movie\\'s slapdash quality is key to its significance . \\ntruth be told , all three of the leads look too wise for high school , but that\\'s ok -- there\\'s a once-removed quality to their fine , spontaneous performances , as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were , the girls they wish they had been , or some combination . \\nfor all its flaws , this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place . \\n', b\"apparantly money talks . \\n . \\n . \\nand uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so ! \\ni've always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess , whether in language , violence , sex , or what have you . \\ni find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard , and money talks definitely does ! \\nit's not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly ( and i mean constantly ! ) , but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged . \\nperhaps if one character were foul mouthed , but in this film , everybody swears nearly every other word . \\nmoney talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett ( played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker ) . \\nfranklin is your typical con-man and ends up with more than one person out to get him . \\nwhen the plot finally gets underway , there's no less than three people ( or groups ) that want him , dead or alive . \\nthe frenchman who's somewhat responsible for franklin's escape from a prisoner-packed bus , a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand , and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder . \\nfranklin's only hope : james russell ( charlie sheen ) , an investigative reporter for the local news who's out to prove himself a worthy journalist . \\njames offers to help clear franklin's name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week . \\nboth of these elements are completely lost along the way however , and never do reappear . \\nas expected , the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end , which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way . \\nthere is just nothing original or intriguing about this film , and so many developments are either non-relevant , or just plain forgotten about . \\nmoney talks is a paint-by-numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience . \\nfrivilous dialogue , a predictable , flat storyline , and two-dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money . \\n\", b'logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . \\nconsidering that the skeptic\\'s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . \\noccasionally , we get a film that does manage it . \\nterry gilliam\\'s \" 12 monkeys \" was one such film . \\nbut more frequently , we get films that don\\'t much deal with it at all . \\nthere is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? \\nthe \" terminator \" films made up for them with exciting action , \" back to the future \" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film \" frequency \" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . \\nis \" frequency \" filled with plot holes ? \\nyes . \\ndoes it matter ? \\nnot really . \\nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \\nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \\nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \\na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \\'69 and that john has found in the present day . \\nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \\nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \\nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \\nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \\nthis isn\\'t explained ; you just have to go with it . \\nwhen frank doesn\\'t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \\nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \\nsometimes frank\\'s changing the past results in something happening right away in john\\'s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \\nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer\\'s murders was because the change had already happened in frank\\'s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren\\'t really the point . \\nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it\\'s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \\nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \\nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \\ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \\ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \\nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin\\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john\\'s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \\n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \\ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \\nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let\\'s face it : it\\'s a darn cool way to end the film . \\nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \\nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \\nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it\\'s a rock-solid job from both actors . \\nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \\nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \\nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don\\'t believe in the characters , we don\\'t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \\nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \\ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \\nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \\nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank\\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \\nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \\nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \\nperhaps the only thing i didn\\'t like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \\nbut that\\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \\ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \\nwho wouldn\\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \\nor see how their children turn out ? \\n \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . \\nand don\\'t call me a sissy . \\n', b'no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , \" jude the obscure , \" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . \\nbut , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . \\n \" jude \" is a satirical film from start to finish about society\\'s way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what\\'s remarkable is how timeless this film is . \\nthe film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn\\'t really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it\\'d be kinda different ( a given ) . \\nit tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from \" shallow grave \" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . \\nin its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . \\nafter marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . \\ntaking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . \\nbut when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . \\nanother reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . \\nshe and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . \\nseveral twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . \\nbecause they aren\\'t married , and because they\\'re cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . \\nif you didn\\'t think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . \\nthe sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . \\nhe will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . \\npart of it is his fault - he\\'s too optimistic , and too gullible . \\nbut society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . \\nthe ending of \" jude \" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i\\'ll have to read it now ) . \\n \" jude \" offers a satirical view on society\\'s cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn\\'t . \\nthere\\'s no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . \\nsatire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people\\'s minds , and that\\'s what \" jude \" is . \\nsure , it\\'s one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . \\nthe film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . \\nchristopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . \\nkate winslet , in a pre- \" titanic \" performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who\\'s troubled but very seductive with her personality . \\nkate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don\\'t believe me , see \" titanic , \" branagh\\'s \" hamlet , \" \" sense and sensibility , \" and \" heavenly creatures , \" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . \\nin the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude\\'s wife , whom he never divorces . \\n \" jude \" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . \\nbut those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate \" jude , \" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it . \\n', b'hey , i\\'ve got a great idea for a movie ! \\nok , here it is : we\\'ll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so ! \\nwhat\\'s that ? \\nsounds too boring ? \\nok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are \" i\\'m in pain ! \" \\nlooks ! \\nwhat\\'s that ? \\nthat still doesn\\'t sound funny to you ? \\nhow about if we through in some \" ewwwww ! \" \\nlooks ? \\nstill not funny ? \\nif you answered \" no , that doesn\\'t sound funny \" , then ( ding ding ding ! ) \\nyou\\'re absolutely correct ! \\nfor richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv\\'s \" seinfeld \" ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion . \\nwhat ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell . \\nwhat makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs . \\n . \\n . \\nnamely , talent ! \\nbacking up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce . \\njust as their marriage seems to be hanging from it\\'s final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton\\'s names . \\nthe irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton\\'s and not lachman , there is nothing much to do . \\n . \\n . \\nexcept run away and join an amish community . \\nfirst time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you\\'ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn . \\nalley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . s . ) . \\nallen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple ! \\nthis entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning ! \\nthe amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing . \\nit\\'s such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they\\'re all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get ! \\nbryan spicer\\'s directing doesn\\'t help one bit , either . \\nin fact , listing spicer\\'s filmography ( which includes the first \" power rangers \" movie and the big screen adaption of mchale\\'s navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? ! \\nnow that i\\'ve pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it . \\nit bumped seven films up a notch on my \" worst of \" 1997 movie list . \\nthat\\'s right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year\\'s worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn\\'t have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list . \\nif you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all ! \\n', b\"review- peter jackson's the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag . \\nbut for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects . \\nand for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily . \\nthe frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get . \\nmichael j . fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts . \\nhe uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them . \\nthis is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago . \\nfrank's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson . \\nwhen dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox . \\nbut dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead . \\nthis leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost . \\nthings start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town . \\nfox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that . \\nso when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer . \\nfox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox's attempts to save her from this evil spirit . \\nthere are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh . \\nthe movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film . \\nthe mix between these genres are perfect . \\nno laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa . \\none point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman . \\nbut that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form . \\nmichael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife's death , and then is forced to confront this later on . \\nalvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine . \\nand jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare . \\nthe frighteners never once feels like it is running long . \\nthe first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters . \\nthis movie is probably what casper would've looked like if david lynch directed it . \\nit's easily the best film of the year , so far . \\n\", b\"in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success . \\nlittle did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film . \\nin january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary . \\nin this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don't do much but call attention to themselves . \\nother than these , the film is exactly the same . \\nwhy pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ? \\nsimply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born . \\nwe should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven't seen it . \\nthe plot is basic but in the same way , complex . \\nit has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight . \\nhis mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) . \\nhe and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker's two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) . \\nskywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force . \\nthe film is obviously quite star-studded . \\nbut how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones' voice would appear so many more times in the future ? \\nit just happened to work out for him . \\nthe magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker's triumph is symbolized by the audience's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever . \\n , \\n\", b'with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late \\'90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically . \\nfor the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer\\'s incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards . \\nlola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day . \\nit seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he doesn\\'t deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed . \\nthis gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies . \\nso she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she\\'ll be able to obtain the money and save a life . \\n>from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like \" sliding doors on steroids . \\nwith a non-stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something . \\nindeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious . \\nvery much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film . \\nthe way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer\\'s movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) . \\nthematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash . \\nwhile you are watching , this will not matter . \\nrunning a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted . \\nit is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n', b'the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole . . . \\nand , in the future , it\\'s also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole . \\nnaturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon . . . \\nthe movie . \\nwhen the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the \" lewis and clark \" has to go to investigate , and dr . william weir , the creator of the \" event horizon , \" gets to come along for the ride . \\nif you\\'ve glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is \" infinite terror . \" \\nwell , i don\\'t know about the \" terror \" part , but \" infinite \" certainly seems to qualify . . . \\nevent horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film . \\nit starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes . \\nat least for those first 40 minutes it\\'s an * interesting * rip-off of alien . \\nthat\\'s a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever . \\nit not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller . \\nit is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore . \\nyou\\'ve seen this kind of movie before . \\nthe hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility . \\nthis is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago . \\nit is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price . \\nthere are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably . \\npaul anderson\\'s direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat . \\nthere are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity . \\nthe sets are beautiful to gaze upon . \\nand richard t . jones\\' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i\\'ve seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has . \\nand none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film . \\nthe idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one . \\na haunted house story in space isn\\'t such a bad idea . \\nbut the final execution is extremely disappointing . \\nthat\\'s not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn\\'t have talent . \\nfor those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off story , and that\\'s something that not too many writers can do . \\nhe even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) . \\nhe definitely has something of a gift , but it\\'s not fully on display here . \\ni certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise . \\nbut because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it . \\nif this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne\\'s sentiment - \" god help us . \" \\n', b'one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy\\'s wedding . \\nand she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . \\nher reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn\\'t made a worthwhile film since 1986 . \\nbut the fact is , betsy\\'s wedding is also an alan alda film . \\nand while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . \\nwritten and directed by alda , betsy\\'s wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . \\nalda\\'s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . \\nas bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . \\nwalsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . \\nringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . \\nshe looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . \\nshe\\'s supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . \\nand to make matters worse , ringwald\\'s performance matches her appearance . \\nthankfully , alda keeps ringwald\\'s screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . \\nthe wedding is just a device to bring together the bride\\'s working-class , italian family and the groom\\'s rich , gentile family . \\nringwald\\'s folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . \\nwalsh\\'s clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . \\nwhen the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , \" money versus values . \" \\nally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film\\'s most pleasant surprises . \\nsheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . \\nit\\'s anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . \\nlapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . \\nlapaglia\\'s sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . \\nand what\\'s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . \\nlapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . \\ni don\\'t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia\\'s over-the-top performance should not be missed . \\nthe scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . \\njoe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda\\'s unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o\\'hara ) . \\nalda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride\\'s financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . \\nthe film adopts alda\\'s psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . \\nas a filmmaker , alda\\'s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . \\nand while he doesn\\'t have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . \\n', b'wong kar-wei\\'s \" fallen angels \" is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i\\'ve seen in a long while . \\nunfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for . \\nordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of \" fallen angels \" , this is not so . \\nevery shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at . \\nwong does really interesting things with the camera , but he doesn\\'t allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal \" knock off \" ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe . \\nugh . ) \\nthe movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives . \\ni can\\'t say much more than that as i didn\\'t really know what was going on most of the time . \\nin fact , it wasn\\'t until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character . \\nthe constantly moving camera doesn\\'t really allow for the audience to associate with any one character . \\nwe\\'re always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters . \\n \" fallen angels \" is a refreshing change-of-pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level . \\nin fact , i\\'d go so far as to say that \" fallen angels \" is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i\\'ve ever seen . \\nsure , there\\'s directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating . \\nbut if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images . \\nthere were far too many instances during \" fallen angels \" in which i asked myself , \" now who are these people again ? \\nis this that first couple or the second couple ? \" \\nit was impossible to keep track . \\nperhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with \" name cards \" , as in scorsese\\'s \" mean streets \" . \\nthat\\'s really besides the point , though . \\nwong kar-wei has proven himself , through very few films , that\\'s he\\'s a movie-maker to watch . \\nlet\\'s just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies . \\n', b'if you\\'re the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland , you\\'re going to love the hunt for red october . \\nyou\\'ll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you\\'re a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan\\'s earlier films , die hard and predator . \\nin fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them . \\nthe hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy\\'s best selling novel . \\nset in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine , called the red october . \\nthe nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection . \\nthe red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery . \\nramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas . \\nhe takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean . \\nis he planning to start world war iii ? \\ncia analyst jack ryan doesn\\'t think so ; he\\'s convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u . s . ryan , played by alec baldwin , is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub . \\nthe characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin , but the performances , thankfully , are rock solid . \\nbaldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor . \\nsam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery\\'s somber first officer . \\nit\\'s ironic to see neil and connery playing russians , since they are both best known for their roles as british agents , connery as james bond and neil as reilly , \" ace of spies . \" \\nthe large cast also includes scott glenn , james earl jones , tim curry , and joss ackland , plus richard jordan as the smooth u . s . national security adviser . \\nthe special effects are remarkable , but more than anything , the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water-tight plot . \\nscreenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns . \\nthey keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t get as sweaty or breathless as die hard , because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with non-stop action . \\nthe finale is rousing and suspenseful , but essentially , the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler . \\n', b\"metro i've seen san francisco in movies many times . \\nthere was 1994's interview with the vampire and most recently the rock . \\nnow , yet again , san francisco is the setting for this movie . \\neddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd . he is their top hostage negotiator , and the very best at what he does . \\nwhen his best friend on the force is killed by joe ( michael wincott , in a terrific performance ) , a psychotic , demented jewel thief , roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again . \\nmeanwhile , roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british ex-girlfriend veronica , while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat who's an expert sniper and marksman ( michael rappaport ) . \\ndespite the obligatory cop movie scenes ( does every cop/new partner movie have to start the same way ? ) \\nwhere the sgt . \\nassigns roper a partner , roper confronts the sarge , etc . , this film is still one heck of an explosive ride . \\na scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed , and boasts some amazing car stunts . \\neddie murphy shines in this tailor-made role , and for once , his character shows depth and concern . \\nwhen confronting joe in prison , you can feel the anger drip from every word . \\nmichael rappaport is basically throwaway . \\nhe serves no purpose , except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day . \\ntypical action escapist fare . \\nmichael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe . \\nnever before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously . \\nmaybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincott's perfectly raspy voice . \\ni don't know . \\nwhat i do know , though , is that although metro is basically a typical action retread , it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches' . \\nthe film is a triumph , and an entertaining one at that . \\nit doesn't meander or trail off from its main character . \\nan enjoyable two hours , metro is enjoyable , witty , action-packed , and fun , and makes for a great action movie that's perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality . \\n\", b'capsule : the world will come to an end at midnight . \\neveryone knows it and must make a final peace with the last hours of their lives . \\nthis is an intelligent science fiction film with no special effects , just personalities and ideas . \\n , high +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \\n- it is the last night of the planet and several different people are reacting each in their own way to the end . \\nthe film covers 6 pm to midnight . \\nthe main character is patrick played by david mckellan who also wrote and directed . \\n- reminiscent of on the beach . \\nbut much more so of a story richard matheson wrote , \" the last day . \" \\n ( p . s . \\non rereading the 1953 matheson , this film is almost a loose adaptation of that story . \\nthe similarities may be mere coincidence , but they are numerous and they are very striking . ) \\n- us release may be problematical . \\nthe title is lackluster and non-memorable , though very appropriate when you know about the film . \\nalso provincial americans may not care about the end of the world coming to toronto . \\nthey probably would feel it would not affect them . \\nperhaps a pbs release would be possible . \\n- patrick\\'s family has declared it christmas and are hurt that the ( adult ) children will not spend the whole evening with them . \\n- grocery stores mostly looted . \\nit seems though that one of everything is left . \\n- some people continue business as usual , some want sex , some react with religion , some riot . \\nsome people are in total denial . \\n- much comedy , much drama . \\n- very canadian cast . \\n- it does not get dark . \\nit is just always daytime . \\n- radio playing \" last night i didn\\'t get to sleep at all . \" \\nhow appropriate . \\n- david cronenberg as a kind of bland functionary manager at the gas company

destroying the world ? \\n', b\"i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . \\na little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . \\nin his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . \\nmrs . \\ndoubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . \\nwhile it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . \\ndoubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . \\nwilliams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . \\none such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . \\nunemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper . \\nhe turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . \\ndaniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . \\nmrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . \\nthe most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . \\nit may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . \\nmore problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . \\nperhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . \\nthere's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . \\nfortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . \\nduring the film , i was generally too busy laughing . \\nafter getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . \\ndoubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . \\ndaniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . \\nclearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . \\nit took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . \\nhe thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . \\nwisely , he never aims for saintly . \\nhis responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . \\nit's one of mrs . \\ndoubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . \\nas miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . \\nthe children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . \\nthe supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . \\nit's easy to see mrs . \\ndoubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . \\nbut mrs . \\ndoubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . \\nthere's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . \\ndoubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . \\nand it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change . \\n\", b' \" what is this , a homicide or a bad b-movie ? \" \\nthat is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie . \\nlet me clear things up for you cupcake , this isn\\'t a bad b-movie , it\\'s a really bad b-movie . \\nso bad , it\\'s almost good . \\nalmost , but not quite . \\nthe movie starts off in the 1950\\'s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth . \\nit is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies . \\nthe slugs\\' first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody . \\nthat is , until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 . \\nhe , and the slugs inside him , promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co-eds into slug zombies . \\na slightly crazed cop ( tom atkins ) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel ( jill whitlow ) join these two geeky university students ( jason lively and steve marshall ) to do battle with the slugs . \\nit more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs . \\nthe acting is bad with a capital b . the story is worse . \\nand the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie . \\nthe only saving grace was the requisite tit-shot courtesy of jill whitlow . \\nit had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it . \\nactually , it was the high point of the movie for me . \\nof course , that isn\\'t really saying much . \\nthe story moves around in a hap hazard fashion . \\nwhich gives it a leg up on some other horror films . \\nunlike most movies of this genre , there actually is a story . \\nnot a great one , but it is there . \\nthis is one in a long line of movies from the 1980\\'s that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th , halloween and nightmare on elm street movies . \\nyou could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better . \\nbut night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b-movie horror marathon . \\njust don\\'t be too upset if you can\\'t find it . \\nyou really won\\'t be missing that much . \\n', b'voices . . . . . trey parker , matt stone , george clooney , minnie driver . \\n \" south park : bigger , longer and uncut \" is undoubtedly crude , offensive , mean-spirited movie , that comes off as a politcally correct movie too . \\nif your canadian , a strong christian , fat , gay or anything else , you will be offended . \\nbut when you watch this movie , there is no doubt that you will laugh . \\nbased on the wildly popular comedy central tv show , south park stars cartman , an overweight , foul-mouthed kid , with attitude , and a sweet side . \\nkenny , a poor kid who gets killed in every episode , and talks with his coat hood covering his head . \\nstan a regular , sometimes boring kid who has problems with women . \\nand kyle a lonely jew who talks to his poop . \\nthe movie opens with a funny , but messageable song , that all of the people of south park sing . \\ncartman , stan , kenny and kyle are very excited to see the new terrance and phillip ( beavis and butthead types ) movie \" asses of fire \" . \\nbut when the kids get up to the movie to get the tickets , they learn the movie is rated r , which of course means that anyone under the age of 17 cannot get in without a parent or legal guardian . \\nthe kids do not understand this , and they pay a homeless man to buy their tickets . \\nwhile in the movie , laughing at the movie , terrance and phillip cuss repeatedly entertaining the kids . \\nthey kids then go out and cuss themselves , getting in trouble and causing kyle\\'s mom to go against the mpaa . \\nwhile doing this kenny learns a thing or to , by proving to cartman he can light his fart on fire . \\nkenny does so , dies , and goes to hell , to find out that satan and saddam huiessan ( homosexual lovers ) , are about to take over the world , if terrance and phillip die . \\n>from here on , nothing more should be said to keep the rest a surprise . \\nbut believe me , this isn\\'t your regular south park tv show , and should not be seen by anyone under 14 or more . \\nthis film contains extreme profanity ( over 130 \" f \" words and a collection of others ) . \\nbut beyond being bad in a tasteless type way , south park : bigger , longer and uncut has many messages that are embedded inside it . \\nbut i bet you will not leave the movie , for at least laughing one time or more . \\nand enjoying yourself . \\ntake it from me , south park : b , l , and u , isn\\'t as good as you\\'d hope , but it is good for some laughs . \\n', b\"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . \\ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \\nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \\ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \\nfurthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \\nand , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \\nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \\nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \\nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \\nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \\nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \\nthe film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \\ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \\nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \\nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \\non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \\none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \\nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \\nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \\nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \\nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \\njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \\nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . \\nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \\ntarzan continues this trend . \\nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . \\nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \\ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \\nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \\nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \\nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \\nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \\nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \\nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \\nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \\nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \\nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \\n\", b' \" oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! \" \\nmrs . pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son . \\n \" didn\\'t i sound just like a mother ? \" \\n \" you are a mother , \" her son marty tells her disgustedly . \\n \" i know , but i still can\\'t believe it . \\ni look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? \" \\nmarty , you see , is a grown-up twin . \\nalthough his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes . \\nmother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko . \\nmost dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is . \\nthe daughter\\'s fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being . \\nmrs . pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level . \\nshe explains to marty\\'s new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty\\'s private part when she came out of the womb . \\nthe dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment . \\nthe script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters . \\nthe exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family\\'s out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane . \\nin this storm are two sane individuals . \\nthe fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o\\'s bitter pseudo-sophistication . \\nas the two twins\\' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr . plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother\\'s fiancee that night . \\n \" we all have our secrets , \" jackie-o tells her potential sister-in-law , and boy , does she have a few . \\nthis is a house filled with them . \\n ( when lesly calls it the family\\'s \" home \" to mrs . pascal -- they\\'ve never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs . pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their \" house . \" ) \\nin a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , \" made for each other , \" the twin\\'s biggest , but not their only secret , is that they\\'ve had a long-term incestuous relationship . \\nthey don\\'t like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it . \\nperfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches . \\njackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his . \\nin one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands . \\nmarty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy . \\nthe chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing . \\nthey put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world . \\ntheir ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best . \\ndirector mark waters keeps the show\\'s energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace . \\nhis crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it . \\njackie-o is temperamentally incapable of being nice . \\nand being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly . \\n \" were you poor ? \" \\njackie-o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished . \\n \" did you eat pies ? \\nchicken pot pies ? \" \\n \" pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , \" lesly replies with her usual sincerity . \\n \" a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , \" \\njackie-o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king . \\n \" are we entertaining royalty ? \" \\nwith rolfe kent\\'s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed . \\nwill it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ? \\nthe emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell . \\ni\\'ll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise . \\nthe house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 . \\nit is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity . \\nthe movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers , i . e . , treat the movie as it were rated nc-17 . \\n', b'while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . \\nand , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . \\nthe trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it\\'s a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you\\'ve seen the animated series on hbo you\\'ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he\\'s been sent to hell . \\ntodd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . \\nnot only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . \\nevery character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . \\nthe story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . \\nal simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . \\nthe next element in the film is the part when things go awry . \\nand as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . \\nas the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . \\ninevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . \\nhence , jason\\'s mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil\\'s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . \\nso , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol\\' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . \\ntime passes . \\nand now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . \\nthis character is merely a poor man\\'s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . \\nnow the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil\\' vs evil . \\nand evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . \\njohn leguizamo\\'s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film\\'s relief point . \\nall this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . \\nand then there\\'s martin sheen . \\nwhichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . \\nhis selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . \\nas the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . \\nthis is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . \\ni\\'d never thought i\\'d be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen\\'s career is in better shape . \\nspawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . \\nfor most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . \\nit constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . \\ncontinually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . \\nperhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . \\nthe filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . \\nthe quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . \\nit is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton\\'s batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . \\nbut bruce wayne had human elements to him . \\nhe was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . \\nthe character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he\\'s fatigued about being normal . \\nand as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . \\nnone of this is present in spawn . \\nthe fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner\\'s . \\nas an example of this film\\'s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . \\nadmittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that\\'s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . \\nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . \\nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . \\nmovies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . \\nand kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . \\nchildren are not muppets . \\nand spawn unapologetically targets children . \\n', b\"well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you . \\nbecause thats all that there really is . . . . \\ni found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot . \\nfor one thing , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity . . . . \\ni am not saying that this isn't possible . . \\nbut it does leave one to wonder . . . i \\nknow i did . \\nanother thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out . . . . \\nand certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations . \\nthere was one scene that should have been short . . . \\nbut it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking . . \\nok enough already get on with it . \\nthere are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do . . . \\nthings just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort . . . \\nanother thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning . \\nthis movie is also very predictable . . . \\nyou can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment . . \\ngranted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you . \\nalso some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated . . . \\nit gets boring at times to tell you the truth . . . \\neven though there is still action going on . \\nanother little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero . \\nsome of the characters are not proper for their roles . \\nthe acting is fine but the characters just don't seem to add up . \\nif i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn't rate this movie too highly but that's just the thing this movie isn't just the plot , its the whole package and this package is really well done . \\nthe whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie . \\nthe special effects are just amazing , you can't tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live , in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn't be able to say that the creature wasn't there during filming , extinct or not . \\nanother thing is the destruction scenes . . . \\nwow , those were masterpieces . . \\nwell some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino's make this one of the reasons to see this movie . \\nthis movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office . . \\nunfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do . . \\ni may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments . . \\ngo see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me . \\none little side note , although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid , there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly . . . . \\nand i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance . . . . \\nyou know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made . . . . . \\ni thought i'd put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick . . . \\nits not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this . \\n\", b'even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality . \\nlike everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies . \\nconsequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf\\'s tribe . \\nlet me start out by saying that krippendorf\\'s tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that\\'s about its only asset . \\nthe best word to describe this film is \" asinine . \" \\nthe target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty . \\nkrippendorf\\'s tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules . \\nthe first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist . \\nthe second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two . \\nfinally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work . \\nonce upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college . \\nhe and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a \" lost tribe \" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished . \\nshortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf\\'s wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own . \\nnow , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings . \\nwhen he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the \" shelmikedmu \" . \\nto provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb . \\nsoon , much to krippendorf\\'s surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon . \\nbut one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud . \\nthe only way krippendorf\\'s tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt . \\nunfortunately , it\\'s impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this . \\ndirector todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags . \\nmeanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i . e . , how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative . \\nthe acting in underwhelming . \\ndreyfuss has definitely not given his \" all \" to the role of james krippendorf . \\nalongside him , jenna elfman , the spunky co-star of tv\\'s dharma and greg , radiates perkiness and little else . \\nthis quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length movie . \\nno one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne ( woody allen\\'s daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels . \\ni know that a movie\\'s in trouble when it\\'s half the length of titanic , but seems much longer . \\nmost of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set . \\nif there\\'s any upside , it\\'s that i don\\'t see much box-office support developing for this lame , ill-marketed miscue . \\nkrippendorf\\'s tribe will quickly become extinct . \\n', b\"well i'll be damned , what a most excellent surprise . \\nnot to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950's drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995 . \\nonce again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer . \\nthe rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns . \\nit seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it's an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent . \\nthe plot in brief . \\npaul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons . \\nhis race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans . \\nhe visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr . rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf . \\nhe also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires . \\nbut before long , amanda and johnson's sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric . \\ni must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging . \\nbritish actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 ) . \\nbut his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding . \\nthe weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character . \\nyork is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic . \\nthis is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i've seen from him . \\nand while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths . \\nthe casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original . \\nthe balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 . \\nthe film doesn't drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h . winkless . \\nand it doesn't matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock . \\nin fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end . \\ntighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation . \\nbut these are minor complaints . \\njust see it . \\nnot of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years . \\nand michael york : in one cool swoop you've made yourself a b-movie legend , dude . \\n\", b'i\\'m not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i\\'m not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it . \\nhowever , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i . e . \\ni didn\\'t like it . \\nif i had to summarize this film , i think i\\'d conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal . \\nthat\\'s the kernel of it , anyway . \\ntossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship . \\nunfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they\\'re simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace . \\nactually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was . \\nthey came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones . \\nthey laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it\\'s rather frightening direction . \\nthree women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town . \\none night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives . \\nin seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be . \\nhe soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power , and his devotion to the women\\'s merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones . \\neven worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him . \\nanyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon\\'s character . \\nwe never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland . \\nas for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson\\'s acting ) , he still can\\'t be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague . \\nand then there\\'s the special effects . \\nnot in themselves--they weren\\'t that good--but their overuse . \\ni was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson-blown-down-the-street stunt . \\nnope , it\\'s another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts/special effects before ( the road warrior , \" nightmare at 20 , 00 feet \" episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn\\'t know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act . \\nf\\'gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson ! \\nlet him loose ! \\nlet him grin demonically ! \\nskip the splitting earth and fake lightning ! \\nwatching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , \" what a waste \" . \\nif you\\'re going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman . \\nnicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he\\'s not sure what he should be doing next . \\nand no wonder . \\nthis script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it\\'d just love to be allegory , but it\\'s not sure about what-- maybe if you give it time it\\'ll think of something . \\nso what is the witches of eastwick ? \\na horror movie ? \\na folk tale ? \\na comedy ? \\na statement about women ? \\nan examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ? \\ni tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching \\nsomeone regurgitate half-digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience . \\nin other words , a mess . \\n ( $2 . 00 ) \\nif you like nicholson enough to watch him here ; maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others . \\n', b\"there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . \\naction movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . \\nfor fans of both genres , however , realism is key . \\naction fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end . \\non this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . \\nmoreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . \\nthe depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years . \\nthe script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . \\na certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . \\nfrankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . \\nhis ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . \\nrobert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . \\nhe takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . \\nthe package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . \\nat times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk . \\nfortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . \\nthe action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews . \\nthe only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . \\nronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . \\nthe suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open . \\nconsidering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month . \\nsince quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit . \\n\", b'go\\'s is a gloriously slick hip machine . \\ndirector liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them . \\nafter more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending . \\nthis is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn\\'t arrive . \\na la tarantino\\'s pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories . \\nthe basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough . \\nher co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas . \\nzack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust . \\nperhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino\\'s non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ; \\npulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go\\'s wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last . \\ntorontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was \" not pleased with \" her turn as the ill-fated cashier . \\nin go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date . \\nhere\\'s an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you . \\nif she doesn\\'t want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said \" no , \" not go . \\nbut i digress . \\ngo is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can\\'t help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride . \\nin that sense , it\\'s a departure from liman\\'s last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan\\'s trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story\\'s clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald\\'s for their latest commercial ) . \\ni wish i cared more about go\\'s characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous . \\nwhen the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me . \\nyet entertain me it did . \\ngo is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs . \\nfichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go . \\nunlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable . \\n', b'this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james . \\ndick turpin ( sid james ) and his gang which includes harriett/harry ( barbara windsor ) and tom \" doc \" scholl ( peter butterworth ) , terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies : \" stand and deliver ! \" \\nowing to the increased occurrence of turpin\\'s robberies , captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners ( kenneth williams ) and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin\\'s area of influence to bring him to justice . \\nthey are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) . \\ntheir intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies . \\nhowever , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin . \\nthen again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner ! \\nthere is no doubt that this is a \\'sid james\\' carry on movie . \\nhe excels in double roles ( as in \\'carry on- don\\'t lose your head\\' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious . \\nbarbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques\\' small but effective role as the rector\\'s housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection . \\njack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part . \\npeter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw\\'s character appears only briefly in the film . \\nthe only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the \\'birds of paradise\\' and sporting a fake french accent . \\nwhen her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit ! \\na carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie . \\nthe jokes are bluer , the script is poorer ( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell ) , but the music is a marked improvement . \\nalthough nearly all the regulars appear , they seem to be just going through the motions . \\nnone of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here . \\njust a selection of crude jokes and repititive double-entendres . \\n', b\"i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality . \\nbut darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations . \\nit's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation . \\nin addition , it's also a terrific family film . \\nthis is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools . \\nit could also be described as `mrs . \\nstreep's opus' . \\nyes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad . \\nout of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view . \\nshe is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ? \\nslowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied . \\none thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven . \\nafter leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama . \\nat first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material . \\nit doesn't carry the heart-warming courage of `mr . \\nholland's opus' , but `music of the heart' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth . \\nthe tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate . \\nyes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work . \\nangela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience . \\nblue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest . \\ngloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force . \\nit's like a schoolteacher's version of `thelma and louise' , in a restrained but effective manner . \\nthe movie tackles more issues than just guaspari's teaching of violin . \\nthere's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman . \\nin it's dramatic build-up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth . \\nit's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life-altering decision . \\nit's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal . \\nwatching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed `scream' ? \\nof course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed `music of the heart' ? \\nmission accomplished , wes . \\nthankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film . \\nin it's entirety , it's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile . \\nthe child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ? d and predictable in the extreme . \\nthe mother who doesn't want her son to be learning `white man's music' , the unexpected casuality . . . \\nbasically everything is there . \\nit doesn't strike the perfect chord , but `music of the heart' is highly convincing . \\nthe uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better , but `music of the heart' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals . \\n\", b'bob the happy bastard\\'s quickie review : \\ni must admit , no doubt\\'s single \" new \" is quite catchy . \\nit was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . \\nthe result ? \\na movie that\\'s just as good as that song , really . \\nit follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . \\nfirst we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he\\'s been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop\\'s strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . \\nreally , it\\'s all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . \\nthe movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . \\nthe dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . \\nthink of it as a , well , ending . \\nthe intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it\\'s never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . \\nhowever , it\\'s better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn\\'t . \\n', b'under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . \\nhowever , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary . \\neven though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk . \\nthe movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm\\'s past patients . \\ndistraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself . \\ncut to the \" next fall \" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn\\'t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) . \\nafter about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has \" the sixth sense \" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead . \\nand this , as they say , is where the healing begins . \\nthe sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert\\'s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of \" siskel and ebert \" ) . \\nalthough i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i\\'ve always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one . \\nhere , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film\\'s conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i\\'ve fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated . \\nand indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment . \\nstripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion . \\nafter seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power . \\nit\\'s a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie . \\nin fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come . \\nand when the final moments do come , it\\'s a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all . \\nit stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level . \\ni won\\'t go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder . \\nnow , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand . \\nhowever , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few \" twilight zone \" episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away . \\nthe fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped . \\nironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl\\'s funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy . \\ni wouldn\\'t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn\\'t , by pure dumb luck , caught \" dateline nbc \" the other week when they did a feature story on it . \\ndespite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn\\'t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation . \\n', b'the formula is simple . \\ntrap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one . \\nthese have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few ) . \\nso , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ? \\n ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example . ) \\nperhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas . \\ndeep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film . \\ntreat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity . . . no \\nquestions asked . \\nthis time , however , they may have gone too far . \\ntheir passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films . \\nand their cargo . . . let\\'s \\njust say it has very high explosive potential . \\nwhat is the target of these thieves ? \\nwhy , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage . \\nbut something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something \\nancient and deadly . \\nby the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed . \\nand now the creature senses fresh meat ! \\nso , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep . \\nand the monster gets to pick them off one by one . \\nfortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer . \\nwhy else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food . \\nif there\\'s a more clarion call for unity , i don\\'t know what it might be . \\nit\\'s pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when . \\nthere are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end . \\nfor the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience\\'s impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first . \\n ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou\\'s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . ) \\ntreat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation . \\nbut while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way . \\nthe biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j . o\\'connor\\'s whining engine-boy , under finnegan\\'s employ . \\nhis constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter ) . \\nit\\'s just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable . \\nas far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency . \\nthink back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters . \\nthey all had a set of \" rules \" about what they could do , and how and why they would do it . \\npart of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are . \\nthe tentacle monster in deep rising doesn\\'t have a set of rules . . . \\nor if it does , not a very good one . \\nit merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so . \\nthe film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place . \\nit simply happens . \\nthe action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy . \\nthe film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic . \\ndeep rising\\'s peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron\\'s ( but can you really blame them ) . \\nunfortunately , deep rising\\'s efforts are more on par with speed 2 . \\non the plus side , however , the film\\'s closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel . \\nperhaps you\\'d be better off waiting for that one . \\n', b'renee zellweger stars as sonia , a young jewish wife and mother frustrated by the constraints of her hasidic community in brooklyn . \\nher husband ( glenn fitzgerald ) is a religious scholar whose all-in-a-day\\'s-work attitude on sex fails to tame the \" fire \" she feels within , as so she confesses to the rebbe ( after hearing her fiery confession , the rebbe suddenly gets frisky with his pleasantly surprised wife--and dies the next morning ) . \\nsensing her frustration , her husband\\'s brother ( christopher eccleston ) gives her a job in his jewelry brokering business in exchange for raw , passionless sex that just fans sonia\\'s still-burning flame . \\non the job , sonia befriends ramon ( allen payne ) , a cool blast of hunky puerto rican water who does his own jewelry designs when not working as a grunt in an upscale jewelry store . \\ncan fire-taming be far be that far behind for the ever-smoldering sonia ? \\njust about everything in writer-director boaz yakin\\'s rings false , starting with the improbably cast zellweger , who does an adequate enough acting job but simply looks too waspy for the role . \\na better fit would have been julianna margulies , who outshines zellweger as sonia\\'s

winning his first nba championship in 1991 . . . or , \\nmy thoughts after meeting him on november 21 , 1997 \\n', b'written by david j . schow and john shirley , based on the comic book series and comic book strip by james o\\'barr . \\ncast brandon lee , ernie hudson , michael wincott , david patrick kelly , rochelle davis , and jon polito . \\nmpaa rating \" r \" ( presumably for rape , language , and violence ) \\nrunning time 100 minutes \\n \" looks like he zigged when he should\\'ve zagged . \" \\n- ernie hudson , as a police officer commenting on a suspicious death . \\ncomic book translations are notorious tricky-- anyone up for a double-bill of the punisher and captain america ? -- and the crow proves no exception . \\ndespite a gross of good intentions , brandon lee\\'s final film doesn\\'t fly very high . \\nthe story opens on halloween eve , better known as devil\\'s night . \\nwilmington-as-detroit is in flames and the police are tending to at least * one * murder : young rock-musician-turned-pavement-artist eric draven ( lee ) , found on a sidewalk six-stories below the apartment he was thrown from . \\nthe cops are also upstairs , administering aid to his fiance who was assaulted and raped and not necessarily in that order . \\nshe dies , the perps . \\nescape , and , exactly one year later , draven rises from the grave to wreak revenge . \\nsound familiar ? \\nunlike charles bronson , whose only known superpower involves an inability to refrain from filming death wish sequels , lee\\'s character has supernatural strength and amazing agility and can even reheal from gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick in terminator 2 . by his side is his crow , the presumable source of his powers as related in the narration . \\nwearing what appears to be alice cooper\\'s leftover make-up , lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape that was obviously modeled after batman and blade runner . \\nbut no number of red-lit , rain-soaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer to darkman than batman . \\n ( the glaring miniatures should show better on video , though . \\n : ) \\na nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi , though , because alex proyas can\\'t film a decent action scene to save his life . \\nhis two \" best \" set-pieces-- some banzai board-room butchery and a cool church- roof sword fight-- are also undercut by the awful editing of dov hoenig and scott smith . \\nblame said editors for the film\\'s frightful flashbacks , as well . \\nbut the pace is quick , thank god , and every good-idea-turned-bad is over before it begins . \\nthe cast is better than it should be . \\nernie hudson is a good choice as a friendly policeman and he gets off most of the film\\'s funnier lines . \\nnewcomer rochelle davis does well as both the narrator and draven\\'s scrappy ward . \\njon polito has a small , succulent role as pungent pawnbroker . \\nand michael wincott makes a distinct impression as a long-haired mr . big whose collection of ancient-swords makes him seem like he walked into the film from the trailer to highlander iii . \\nthere can be only one . \\nfinally , there\\'s brandon lee , son of bruce lee , and a 28-year-old rising-star who was fatally shot during shooting . \\nlee had four films to his name-- kung fu : the movie , laser mission , showdown in little toyko , and rapid fire-- and the crow would\\'ve been a nice feather in his belt and that\\'s about it . \\nthere\\'s nothing great from him here-- just a good performance that owes as much to presence as ability . \\nwhen the echo of that gunshot finally fades , watching the crow should prove an even * less * remarkable experience . \\ndespite a healthy dose of humor and some surprising sincerity , the crow is still just a couple notches above its straight-to-video brethren . \\nfor now , maybe it\\'s an appropriate eulogy to an actor who could only get better . \\n', b'in my review of \" the spy who shagged me , \" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore . \\nthe cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing . \\n \" scream 3 \" provides the latest proof of this rule . \\nin los angeles production has begun on \" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , \" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) . \\nhowever , life soon starts imitating art , and \" stab \" cast members turn up stabbed . \\nsmelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in \" stab 3 . \" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name . \\n . \\n . \\nuntil she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice . \\nthe late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy . \\nhe notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with . \\nindeed , \" scream 3 \" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney\\'s mother maureen before the beginning of the original \" scream . \" \\nat the scene of each murder in \" scream 3 , \" the killer leaves a photo of sidney\\'s mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer . \\nto find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen\\'s missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films . \\n ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer\\'s relationship to sidney is ) . \\nunlike its predecessors , \" scream 3 \" doesn\\'t have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer . \\nthe characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don\\'t even care who the killer is . \\nthe jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ? \\nthe kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ? \\nthe driven young director ( scott foley ) ? \\nthe ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ? \\nthe character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random . \\nwes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it\\'s quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen . \\nthe series\\' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious . \\npossibly it\\'s the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it\\'s that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche . \\ni groaned as an attack on sidney from the first \" scream \" was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home . \\nat some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas . \\n \" scream 3 \" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles . \\nlook for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from \" seinfeld \" ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point . \\nall these bit players put forth more effort than the series\\' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- \" scream \" job search . \\nanother prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying \" the blair witch project \" \\'s web strategy . \\n \" scream 3 \" has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie . \\nthe sunrise studios site ( scream3 . com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the \" latest \\'stab 3\\' news . \" \\nthere\\'s also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers . com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more \" stab \" scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks . com ) . \\ncraven and company promise that this is the last installment in the \" scream \" series . \\nwhile i hope that\\'s true , i don\\'t hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters . \\nthere\\'s a \" halloween h2k \" in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in \" h20 , \" and a \" freddy vs . jason \" has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were \" killed off . \" \\nthere\\'s bound to be a \" scream 4 \" someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes . \\nbottom line : they should have called this one \" yawn . \" \\n', b'before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen . \\nthis is a very important note because allen\\'s films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone . \\ni know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol\\' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again . \\ni love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s . \\nin fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! \\nif you look at the quality of those films , you\\'ll hear what i\\'m saying . \\nthe only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives . \\nin fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some \" time off \" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn\\'t appear as though he has any intention of doing that . \\nso here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old . \\nplot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator . \\nhis methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date . \\na new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency . \\nthe two do not like each other . \\none night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control . \\nsoon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer . \\ncritique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline . \\non the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy . \\nthe sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man . \\nbut it wasn\\'t not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick . \\ni also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron\\'s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) . \\nof course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn\\'t his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude . \\nhe actually plays a \" macho \" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he\\'s hypnotized . \\nbut the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly \" sick of seeing \" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) . \\nanyway , she\\'s really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn\\'t miss a beat of allen\\'s fast-paced dialogue . \\ni didn\\'t care much for her running joke about him \" dying \" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum , \\nyum ! \\nharumph , but i digress . \\nso let\\'s recap . \\na great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn\\'t expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around . \\ni can\\'t say that this is even remotely close to any of allen\\'s best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through . \\nit\\'s probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , \" old-school \" kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion . \\nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : annie hall ( 10/10 ) - celebrity ( 5/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - husbands and wives ( 9/10 ) - mighty aphrodite ( 5/10 ) - small time crooks ( 7/10 ) - when harry met sally ( 10/10 ) - you\\'ve got mail ( 4/10 ) \\n', b\"tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever . \\nnot surprising , considering its tiny us$100 , 000 budget , to date it has earned in excess of us$130 million . \\nthat's a shocking 100 times profit ! \\nrumours have it that a smart internet `marketing' ploy was so successful in gaining cult-like fanatics , by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews , the film just exploded in the box-office , raking in millions on its opening weekend . \\nshot in 16mm and video ( i suspect\\x05 . ) , the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch . \\naudiences are put in the first-person perspective in the entire mis-adventure , often wobbly and blurry at times , it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning . \\nthis is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared ; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences . \\ntbwp is simply smart . \\nfilmed to look as if it was really a stock-shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project , one may suspect ( like yours truly ) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film-making . \\nsimply amazing in that respect , i must say . \\ntalk about impact , oh yes , tbwp does have quite a bit , in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing . \\ni did , especially the last bit but i'm not revealing more . \\nyou have to see it for yourself . \\ni can't help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become . \\ncould it be that finally , an indie-film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal ? \\nor was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning ? \\nwell , i guess the fact stays ; tbwp is highly original , clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film . \\nno gore , no special effects , i just can't get over how terribly smart this film is ! \\n\", b'i cried during _babe_ . \\ni admit it . \\nthe special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a \" children\\'s film \" --so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental . \\nsuch , my friend , is the power of cinema . \\nwhen word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations . \\nthey can\\'t possibly drop the ball on this one . \\ncan\\'t miss . \\ncan\\'t possibly miss . \\nthey missed . \\nwhat went wrong ? \\nafter much thought , i supply three general rules . \\n ( 1 ) don\\'t let a television actress-turned-comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i . e . , penny marshall\\'s dreadful \" preacher\\'s wife \" ) . \\nbetty thomas worked wonders with \" the brady bunch movie \" , but the same sitcom-airiness doesn\\'t quite work here . \\nit\\'s as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r&b . \\ntake away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid-80\\'s kirk cameron show . \\n ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast-member has to do ( i . e . , \\n \" con air \" ) . \\nit is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one-line-at-a-time . \\nit\\'s even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don\\'t get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits . \\nnow there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he\\'s in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy . \\nnorm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle . \\nbut there\\'s little humor here . \\nthat rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise-ass guinea pig . \\neven the mouth is ill-synched . \\n ( 3 ) don\\'t let the special effects technicians walk away with the script . \\nthere\\'s a certain timing that\\'s mandatory in comedy . \\nto have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson\\'s creature shop , is a travesty . \\nthis is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren\\'t well-timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have . \\nhere , betty thomas is clearly over her head . \\ni wish i could commend the special effects , but they\\'re merely average . \\ncount the number of times where the animal\\'s mouth is turned away from the camera , or too far to notice , or ill-synched . \\nthis is less a \" babe \" and more of a \" look who\\'s barking \" clone . \\nyou may be wondering , \\'how does eddie murphy fare ? \\' \\nwell , he came back with the exceptional \" nutty professor \" , and i don\\'t doubt he can come back again . \\nhere , he\\'s tied into a straight man and given little to do . \\nthe exceptions are when he fears he\\'s going crazy : a far cry from his smarter-than-you\\'d expect routine that he\\'s more adept at . \\nit\\'s unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago , making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years . \\nafter all this , what\\'s left ? \\nbutt jokes . \\na _lot_ of butt jokes . \\ni guess for kids that may be funny , but i was stone-faced . \\nif there\\'s a lesson the film may be telling us , is that animals have feelings too , and they care way too much for your butt . \\n', b\"one of the best movies i've ever seen . \\ni'd heard extremely good things about this movie , and though the previews didn't really intrigue that much , it was a movie i'd been anticipating for a few months now . \\nfor some reason i'm not sure of - this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u . s . it was a definite hit with the critics , but didn't exactly set any box office records . \\nafter viewing this incredibly well directed , written and acted movie , i can't help but wonder - why ? \\nthe strength of this film is it's gritty realism . \\nthe main characters are all human with individual flaws , no stereo-type hollywood heroes . \\nyou may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life , but that is what makes it so real . \\ni had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller , but i was mistaken . \\neven the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase . \\nand the ending . . . . . . whoa . \\ni've never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly . \\nthe three male leads - guy pearce , kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific . \\nthe 'best actor' oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue , but there is one problem there . \\nhow could they have chosen between these three actors ? \\nthere is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two . \\nit's impossible . \\nkim bassinger's performance is also a revelation . \\ni'd never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was , well . . . what's the word - a twinky ? \\nthat impression has changed , as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly . \\nthe depth to the story and characters is truly astounding . \\nno cardboard characters here . \\nthe plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences . \\npearce's interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant . \\ni really can't fault this movie at all . \\ni was so glad to see fellow australian's pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie . \\ni had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films , but had not seen much of guy pearce . \\ni intend to change this next time i visit the video store : ) \\n\", b'the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images . \\nthe tinkling christmas tree bell in \" it\\'s a wonderful life . \" \\nbogie\\'s speech at the airport in \" casablanca . \" \\nlittle elliott\\'s flying bicycle , silhouetted by the moon in \" e . t . \" \\nand now , \" starship troopers \" director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug . \\n \" starship troopers , \" loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects . \\nin the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale . \\nto put it simply , it\\'s a bug bomb . \\nin \" robocop \" and \" total recall , \" verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and \" starship troopers \" starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise . \\nthings go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school . \\ninexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial . \\nit\\'s a veritable \" alpha centuri 90210 \" as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love . \\nmichael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities . \\neventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds . \\none of their classmates , carl jenkins ( \" doogie houser\\'s \" neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities . \\nhe displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother\\'s leg . \\na long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the \" showgirls \" director\\'s camera roams over their buff bodies . \\nfinally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy . \\nthe bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space . \\nthey attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears . \\nyes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts . \\na phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best . \\nsweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter . \\nthe insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating . \\nthe attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension . \\nwhile the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly . \\nverhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children \" doing their part for the war effort \" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren\\'t enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck . \\none can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here . \\nhis customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders . \\nin \" showgirls \" fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good . \\nan intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing \" dixie \" on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal . \\na sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn\\'t mind dying . \\n \" it\\'s okay , \" she gasps , \" i got to have you ! \" \\nand then , of course , there\\'s doogie\\'s mind meld with a bug . \\nit\\'s possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel . \\nheinlein\\'s pre- \" stranger in a strange land \" books were aimed at adolescent males , and \" starship troopers \" has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi . \\nthe one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting . \\nthe hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion . \\nultimately , verhoeven\\'s motives are irrelevant . \\nhe has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire . \\nit even fails to be an entertaining bad movie . \\navoid \" starship troopers \" at all costs . \\n', b'let\\'s say you live at the end of an airport runway . \\nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \\nlet\\'s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \\nnow let\\'s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it\\'s worth . \\nwouldn\\'t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \\nof course you would . \\nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \\nthat\\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\\'s not for sale . \\nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \\nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \\nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \\nin fact , it is this film\\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \\nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \\nit\\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \\ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \\nthe situation is one we\\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \\nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \\ndarryl thinks he\\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \\nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for \" investments \" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \\nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \\nthey\\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \\nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \\nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \\nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \\ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \\ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \\nit\\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \\ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \\nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \\none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \\nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\\'s running time . \\nluckily , it\\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \\nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \\ni\\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \\nand , for that matter , it\\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \\n', b'about an hour or so into \" the jackal , \" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out \" i hope she gets killed now ! \" \\nat that point it hit me : i didn\\'t care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn\\'t really like . \\nwhen the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he\\'s being played by sidney poitier , you know something\\'s rotten in the state of denmark . \\nevery year , a couple films like this are released . \\nyou know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . \\nthis was the third one of \\'97 , following the very lackluster \" the saint , \" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun \" the peacemaker , \" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . \\n \" the jackal \" tries to mix both elements . \\nand you thought \" the saint \" was bad . \\n \" the jackal \" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i\\'ve yet to see , \" the day of the jackal , \" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . \\nwell , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or \\nis he ? \\nafter being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he\\'ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . \\nand like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . \\nthe agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from \" romeo + juliet \" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of \\'97 ) who\\'s in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . \\nsoon , he\\'s out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . \\nthere are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . \\nthe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . \\nsure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . \\nthe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . \\nit doesn\\'t help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . \\nthe script of \" the jackal \" is a complete mess , mostly because it can\\'t decide what it wants to focus on . \\nis this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? \\nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who\\'s in everything for the money ? \\nor is it a combination of both ? \\n \" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . \\nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . \\nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . \\nthe supporting characters are worse . \\nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . \\nwhat is poitier doing here ? \\nhe\\'s one of the best living actors ! \\ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? \\ndiane venora\\'s russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . \\nit\\'s not that anyone\\'s bad here ; it\\'s that they have nothing to do . \\nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . \\nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . \\nthere are several times where he\\'s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . \\ntake a scene where he\\'s being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . \\ndoesn\\'t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? \\nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? \\ngeez ! \\nis there anything good here ? \\nwell . . . a \\ncouple things . \\ni did like willis\\'s icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . \\nrichard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . \\nand a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . \\nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they\\'re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is \" the jackal . \" \\ndirector michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior \" rob roy \" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . \\nevery now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( \" clear and present danger , \" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but \" the jackal \" is an example of when they go completely wrong . \\n', b\"the happy bastard's quick movie review \\nholy man \\nmore like holy crap . \\nthe film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands . \\nsomehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures . \\nit's here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales . \\nat this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) . \\nit doesn't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush , with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points . \\nonly a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild's face seems to have any interest in the movie . \\nmurphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he'd rather be someplace else . \\nsome may argue that the movie has a message , but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat . \\nat least he has something for us to laught at . . . \\n\", b'1992\\'s alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979\\'s alien and 1986\\'s aliens , savaged david fincher\\'s slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . \\nhence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . \\ndespite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . \\nwriter joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . \\nthat done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . \\nalien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . \\nwhat could be next ? \\nwhedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also \" infected \" with alien dna . \\nso the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . \\nunfortunately , that is where alien resurrection\\'s clever streak in writing stops . \\nthe alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . \\nbut the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . \\nthe movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . \\nand the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . \\nwhile the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . \\nthe alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . \\nthe violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . \\nthe film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . \\nas technically adept as jeunet\\'s direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon\\'s ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . \\na sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . \\nno , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott\\'s alien or the even greater film that james cameron\\'s aliens was . \\nbut after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher\\'s alien3 , jeunet\\'s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . \\nthat is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . \\n', b'first troy beyer wrote the critically panned \" b . a . p . s . \" \\nnow she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex . \\nthough not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad . \\nthe basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love . \\njazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating . \\nshe and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami . \\nthe film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters . \\nthe fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film . \\nthere are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . \\nin a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid . \\nthat is not the case here . \\nthe script suffers from random plot developments . \\nthere are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question \" where did that come from ? \" \\nat one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother . \\nwe are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don\\'t care if she and her mother get along . \\nwe\\'ve never seen her mother before . \\nwe never see her again . \\nwho cares ? \\nwhat\\'s worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy . \\nat another point , a character announces that she can\\'t have children . \\napparently , this is devastating . \\nwe wouldn\\'t know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . \\nthe scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow . \\nthese scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax . \\ntwo scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing . \\none scene is a lover\\'s spat between two minor characters . \\nthe other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax . \\nthinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities . \\nbut it does . \\nfirst , it is original . \\nwe men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . \\nit\\'s something i don\\'t think has been the subject of a film . \\nsecond , the interviews of the miami women are sincere . \\ntaken together , they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners . \\nthe mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each tile is some woman\\'s real experience . \\nneither the picture of women , nor their picture of men , is truly representative , but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way . \\nat some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true . \\ni can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their \" likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , \" but on the whole , it\\'s pretty bad . \\nand that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . \\ni\\'ll give beyer one more strike , and then she\\'s out . \\nrated r ( almost got an nc-17 ) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity . \\n', b'yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn\\'t even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex . \\nneve campbell and starship trooper\\'s denise richards getting it on ? \\nok ! \\nyeah , it\\'s a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that\\'s your main interest in this film , there\\'s plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes . \\nwild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however . \\nnearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie . \\nbut this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn\\'t leave much time to enjoy the surprises . \\nwe start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making . \\nguidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts . \\nright off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce \" mr . lombardo \" . \\nthe fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor\\'s jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you\\'ll be soaked from head to toe when you\\'re done . \\non the weekend of the car wash , kelly\\'s attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day . \\nnaturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations . \\nbut the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor . \\npitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray . \\nyes , that bill murray ! \\nsound like a good , complete movie ? \\nyes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning . \\nin fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film . \\nit is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time . \\nby the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable . \\nunfortunately , with so much going on , you\\'re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about . \\nthis is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could\\'ve been . \\nthe 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could\\'ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken . \\nthe acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing . \\nand it\\'s not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap \" party of five \" , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones . \\ndillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year\\'s in & out , gives the best performance , and murray\\'s surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film . \\nin fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade . \\nthat\\'s how cheezy it comes off . \\nbut aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full\\'s . \\nin the right hands , wild things could\\'ve been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting . \\nand what\\'s up with these people passing as high school students ? \\ni realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn\\'t supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker . \\ni won\\'t lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure . \\nas corny as it is , it\\'s got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a \" b \" for effort . \\nbut if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year\\'s starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better . \\nof course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you\\'ll be right at home with wild things . \\nperhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters . \\n', b' \" battlefield earth \" is the best comedy of the year . \\nit has to be . \\nthe other prospect is just too horrifying to consider . \\nbad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much \" battlefield earth \" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand . \\nis it as bad as advertised ? \\noh yes , very much so . \\nthe plot is incomprehensible . \\nthe acting is atrocious . \\nthe special effects are mediocre . \\nthe action is dull . \\nthe implausibilities are legion . \\nthe dialogue is cringe-inducing . \\nthe whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny . \\ni don\\'t even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i\\'d like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : \\nthe premise is basically a rip-off of \" planet of the apes , \" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo . \\nthe year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved . \\nonly a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear . \\none man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos . \\nthere he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) . \\npressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back . \\nmeanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he\\'s stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man\\'s daughter . \\nhe decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous . \\n . \\n . ) \\nso the \" man-animal \" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can\\'t go . \\nterl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself . \\nof course , his plan doesn\\'t work . \\nso many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ? \\nhow about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l . ron hubbard\\'s sci-fi novel ? \\nearly previews for \" battlefield earth , \" with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , \" what the hell is travolta thinking ? \" \\nthe movie did nothing to stem such remarks . \\nall that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo . \\nof course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary . \\nthe psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don\\'t laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees . \\n ( \" you were going to be promoted -- but now you\\'re not ! \\nfwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! \" ) \\nit\\'s no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he\\'s an idiot . \\nhe breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book . \\nhe underestimates his enemies , assuming he\\'ll win just because he\\'s smarter . \\n ( he uses the word \" leverage \" like some sort of scientologist mantra . ) \\nnot content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos\\' language and technology . \\n ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . ) \\nhe then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him . \\nno wonder this guy never got his promotion . \\nthe plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention . \\nwhy do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ? \\nhow come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ? \\nhow in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ? \\nand how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ? \\nthere\\'s a whole lot more to scratch one\\'s head about in \" battlefield earth . \" \\nbring a scorecard to track the plot holes . \\ndirector roger christian shoots \" battlefield earth \" in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason . \\nall the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it\\'s awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue . \\nthe action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement . \\nare these things really so hard to construct ? \\nmy respect for supposed \" lightweight \" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in \" battlefield earth \" how badly an action sequence can be shot . \\nthis movie is an absolute headache . \\nit\\'s not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense . \\nfor most of \" battlefield earth\\'s \" running time , i just didn\\'t know what was happening . \\nit didn\\'t have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on . \\nwhen i pieced the plot together later , it didn\\'t look any better . \\nhere\\'s how much of a disaster this is : \" battlefield earth \" is already the worst movie of the year , and it\\'s going to take something really , really inept to top it . \\nthe only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it . \\nin fact , i\\'d think that hubbard\\'s cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible . \\nthat\\'ll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again . \\n', b'this summer , one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham\\'s series , a time to kill , was made into a major motion picture . \\non january 3 of this year , director rob reiner basically re-released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi . \\nbased on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars\\' assassination , ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars ( whoopi goldberg , sister act ) and her quest to have her husband\\'s obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith ( james woods , casino ) jailed . \\nso she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter ( alec baldwin , heaven\\'s prisoners ) to imprison the former kkk member . \\nghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african-american history , from slave-ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960\\'s . \\nbut all too soon , the white folks take over , intoning lines like \" what\\'s america got to do with anything ? \\nthis is mississippi ! \" \\nas beckwith , james woods , with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man , teeters between portraying evil and its character . \\nmeanwhile , goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn\\'t let her husband\\'s death rest until she got the conviction . \\nboth deserve serious oscar-consideration . \\nthis brings us to the dull performance of baldwin . \\nlet\\'s face it , trying to match matthew mcconaughey\\'s wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible . \\nand baldwin is living proof of this , as no emotions could be felt . \\nit seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear . \\neither poor acting or poor directing , but something definitely went wrong . \\nanother strange mishap was the fact that goldberg\\'s facial features didn\\'t change , as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husband\\'s dead body 25-years earlier . \\nyet woods\\' was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg\\'s father . \\nat least the make-up was realistic . \\nwith some emotional moments in the poorly written script , ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart , when its predecessor , a time to kill , brought tears to everyone\\'s eyes . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong , the movie wasn\\'t all that bad , but if you\\'ve seen grisham\\'s masterpiece , then don\\'t expect this one to be an excellent film . \\n , \\n', b'i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . \\nlost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . \\nhis humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . \\nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent \" talk films \" which are finding their way into theaters . \\nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can\\'t , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . \\nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably won\\'t find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . \\nput simply , brooks\\' comedy is intelligent . \\nmother is albert brooks\\' latest film , and it does not disappoint . \\nbrooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . \\nhe makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . \\nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . \\njeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . \\nafter dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . \\nin comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . \\nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john\\'s life , she says , \" i love you , \" and john replies with , \" i know you think you do . \" \\nthe thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . \\nit\\'s the kind that goes something like , \" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . \" \\nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . \\nthere\\'s always the big but . \\njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . \\nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \\n \" a great experiment \" , he calls it . \\nbrooks\\' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . \\nthere\\'s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother\\'s house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the \" great experiment \" , beatrice asks , \" now explain to me again why you don\\'t want to stay at a hotel . \" \\nshe still doesn\\'t get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . \\nin the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . \\nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . \\nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . \\n \" you\\'ve named the ice ? \" \\nasks john . \\nhe\\'s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . \\n \" the freezer was a good invention , \" says john , \" but it\\'s not supposed to be used for everything . \\nthat\\'s why it\\'s smaller than the refrigerator . \" \\nit\\'s something most of us find strangely familiar . \\nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . \\nfor example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep\\'s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . \\nwhen they\\'re finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is

scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . \\nin this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . \\ni don\\'t want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . \\njohn\\'s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . \\nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . \\nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . \\non screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . \\nin a way , he\\'s very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . \\ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . \\nshe assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it\\'s hard to get mad at her character . \\nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . \\nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer\\'s disease . \\nthat may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . \\nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother\\'s favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama\\'s boy . \\nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . \\na solid connection is not really made between john\\'s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . \\nadditionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : \\nbeatrice : you must think i\\'m some kind of moron . \\njohn : no , i think your someone who thinks i\\'m a moron . \\nbeatrice : well , it takes one

would , i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things . \\ni am befuddled by fight club . \\nnow sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later . \\nperhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time . \\nperhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them . \\nfight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former . \\nmaybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold . \\nbut if it is , i sure don ? t see it . \\nedward norton plays jack , a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer . \\nhis insomnia , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to ? complete ? himself , make

outside tyler ? s house for three days . \\ni dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film , since that contains the twist that ? explains ? the pointless journey . \\nsuffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher , who ? s previous two films , se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation . \\nthis is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table . \\nbut with fight club , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good ? flashback humor ? . \\nnow , throughout the film ? s coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot lines , fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today . \\nadvertisements , inter-office politics , corporations , you name it , it ? s addressed . \\n ( though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced . ) \\nall of them play an important role . \\nhow so ? \\nwell , i can kinda just tell . \\ni can

desperate to make a point , or a number of points , but i couldn ? t figure out what they were . \\nall i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques , a bleak visual design and some fine acting . \\n ( pitt , carter , norton . . . all of them are good . \\neven meatloaf is good . ) \\nwhen you get to the end , you will most likely be filled with questions , many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself . \\nnot them , because each of them would likely give you a different answer . \\nfight club means what you want it to mean , i think

\\n| now with search engine * * * \\na strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean\\'s graphic novel \" arkham asylum \" , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a \" valentine \" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald\\'s strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . \\nbelieving at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . \\nhis minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he\\'s a nut , that doesn\\'t mean that he can\\'t solve a high-profile society murder . \\nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus\\'s \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane\\'s urban noir hero , spawn . \\nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren\\'t inscribed with \" gotham pd . \" \\nthat being said , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \\nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane\\'s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \\nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus\\' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \\nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \\nit , along with m . night shyamalan\\'s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller\\'s seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \\nreaders of sam keith\\'s brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv\\'s short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \\nthe failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america\\'s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \\nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer\\'s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \\nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve\\'s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \\nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot\\'s rat\\'s alley wasteland . \\n', b\"running time approximately 1hr 40mins \\nreviewed by jack choo \\nrating : \\nthe movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence , rather cool and sets the mood for things to come . \\nthe story propels the audience into a neo-reality ; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red . \\nexistenz is actually the name of a new virtual-reality game . \\nsupposedly , vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality . \\n * * * * ( leigh ) is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of existenz . \\nplayers are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine , which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the

\\n * * * is more of a realists than anything else , afraid that he'll lose reality if he begin to play these games but * * * requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt . \\nas they soon discover , they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected . \\nexistenz has all the cronenberg-gore that is expected of him . \\neven so , this film is no-where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners . \\nnot even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly . \\nexistenz can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of videodrome , even so , it is a poor follow-up . \\nwhile in most of his famed films , his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot . \\nin existenz , the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over-indulgence than anything else . \\njennifer jason leigh and jude law , both commendable actors , looked aloof and miss-directed throughout the entire film . \\nthe scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b-grade category . \\nit was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film ( the opening sequence , though , probably formed a considerable portion of the budget ! ) \\nwhich is actually quite good . \\nexistenz is too predictable and cliched in these times . \\n10 years ago , it would have been another classic for cronenberg . \\ncronenberg fans however , ( those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film ) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you . \\n\", b'preposterous religious action film ( produced by the trinity broadcasting network ) about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world ( nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh ? ) . \\nmichael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies , while casper van dien ( terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a result ) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him . \\nmichael ironside ( great as always , despite the silly film surrounding him ) plays a fallen priest and right hand man to michael york\\'s character . \\nhere\\'s some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside\\'s character . \\nnow despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene , the filmmakers aren\\'t quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil . \\nhow do they fix that ? \\nmake specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes ! \\nthere are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking . . . \\noooooo scary . \\nbut even that wasn\\'t enough for the filmmakers apparently , as they later have to infer that ironside\\'s character is gay ! \\nit comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense . \\nmy main problem with this film is that , despite the silly story ( which could have been pulled off . . . \\nanything can be made believable if executed correctly ) , the events of the film aren\\'t shown with any sense of urgency or importance . \\nfor example , at one point york\\'s character is declared chancellor of the world or something , and we see one brief , cheesy news report about it . \\nthe movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming , but it never seems that way . \\nthere\\'s no \" world reaction \" to anything . \\nthe omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video . \\nit contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and includes the original theatrical trailer , a documentary on the making of the film , production notes , and cast and crew information . \\nthe documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good ( it looks as though it was made for broadcast on tbn ) , and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and crew ( with the exception of michael ironside , unfortunately ) . \\nthe best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed , they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on a movie set . \\nmost documentaries tend to overlook this . \\ndoomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed ( you\\'ll remember his documentary from the 1970\\'s called the late great planet earth , where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist ) . \\nhowever , at the very beginning of the documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side . \\nwhen interviewed they actually have the nerve to say \" ever see raiders of the lost ark ? \\nwell , our film is like that ! \" \\nno it isn\\'t . \\nnot by a long shot . \\n[pg-13] \\n', b'you don\\'t have to know poker to like \" rounders , \" but it might help . \\nthat a great deal of this sharp little drama is set in the back rooms of new york\\'s cardshark underground astoundingly doesn\\'t limit its accessibility , even for those who can\\'t tell royal and straight flushes apart . \\n \" rounders \" \\' success , then , is owed to its proficient cast and intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familiar with . \\nthe dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp , but you don\\'t have to speak the language to understand the words - a statement that pretty much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show . \\nmatt damon , fresh off his \" good will hunting \" hot streak , is perfect for the role of mike mcdermott , a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling . \\nbut after losing all of his tuition money in a killer high-stakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb ( john malkovich , deliciously hammy ) , he shifts his focus to scholarly matters , leaving his true area of expertise far , far behind . \\nthings change , however , when mike\\'s old buddy worm ( edward norton ) re-enters his life - it seems worm , just out of jail , owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs , and is counting on his friend\\'s superlative skills to help him pay off the debt . \\nthat \" rounders \" \\' story quickly molds itself into a conventional , predictable tale of redemption doesn\\'t hinder its potency . \\ndirector john dahl , infamous for his neo-noirs \" red rock west \" and \" the last seduction , \" gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been-there , done-that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm . \\ndamon and norton bring so much to their roles that they\\'d be worth catching even if \" rounders \" ultimately folded , but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning . \\nany sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight . \\nif only the other character interaction was as successful , \" rounders \" might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year\\'s best films . \\ncurrent \" it girl \" gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike\\'s girlfriend jo , aware and weary of his seedy past , but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective . \\njohn turturro\\'s aging mentor and famke janssen\\'s tempting siren , both interesting sketches , are hampered by the same limited screen time . \\nand as a wizened judge , the great martin landau makes memorable a role that\\'s mostly a plot device - he\\'s on hand mostly to sort-of save the day and provide a voice for \" rounders \" \\' moral . \\nthat moral , by the way , is \" our destiny chooses us , \" and it\\'s something of a surprise when \" rounders \" supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect ; mike does learn from his mistake , but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be . \\nin the end , \" rounders \" sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form , but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture . \\nthe road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions , the movie espouses , no matter what they might be . \\nhere , low-rent lowlifes like worm just aren\\'t cut out for the cards . \\nscreenwriters david levien and brian koppelman entertain and educate in their quest to vividly render a culture that\\'s often generalized by movies ; even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from observers to participants when the movie gets to its concluding game scene . \\ninside every adventurous filmgoer , there is a desire to be taken someplace new and exciting , and that\\'s the precise allure of \" rounders . \" \\nit ultimately matters not that a few of our tour guides feel partially-realized or that the journey itself is cluttered with sites we\\'ve seen before , because the final destination is a satisfying one . \\nin the end , \" rounders \" holds a winning hand . \\n', b'for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . \\nsadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver . \\nand not a particularly good one at that . \\nwhat went wrong ? \\nmi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it\\'ll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise\\'s firing gun just so they can die really cool . \\nearly on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . \\nin one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other\\'s eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . \\nprior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . \\nwhy ? \\ni haven\\'t the foggiest . \\ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . \\nwith mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . \\nit\\'s possible that these \" spies \" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . \\nthe scenes i\\'ve described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . \\ngod forbid . \\nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . \\nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . \\ncruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . \\nbetween the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . \\nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . \\nsure it\\'s all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . \\nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that\\'s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \\\\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . \\nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . \\nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously . \\ncruise grins a little too slyly . \\nthe cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . \\nhere cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . \\nhe\\'s cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90\\'s ) . \\nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise\\'s initial \" i\\'m the man ! \" \\ncharm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . \\nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won\\'t stop . \\nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could\\'ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the \" symbolic \" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . \\nwe\\'ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . \\nit isn\\'t done any differently here . \\nthe action is pure hard target \\\\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . \\nhe\\'s cool for sure but he\\'s made to be as empty as the movie . \\nthe actor isn\\'t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . \\nwhen he\\'s not beaming away , he\\'s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo\\'s editing seriously undermines the effort . \\nhe fetishizes cruise\\'s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . \\ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he\\'s really austin powers . \\nin a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . \\nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . \\nthe lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles . \\nthough instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a \" so you thought i was dead . . . \" . \\nnot to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat . \\nwhat a hero ! \\nyou may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2\\'s plot . \\nmy reasoning is simple : i\\'m not sure of any good it would do . \\nthe film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next \" special \" effect . \\ni wasn\\'t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . \\nnobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they\\'ll surely regret it . \\nas summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . \\nin mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma\\'s ( that film\\'s director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo\\'s non-stop masturbatory pandemonium . \\nit\\'s irrelevant in every sense , as is character . \\nall that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors . \\n', b'apocalypse now , based on the novel \" hearts of darkness \" , is an extremely striking , gripping , and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle . \\na long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti-war film . \\nin many ways , this debate could go either way . \\napocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made . \\nin addition , now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years . \\napocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l . willard , played by martin sheen , to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e . kurtz , a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia . \\ncaptain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with \" extreme prejudice \" because he has been deemed a murderer . \\nwillard accepts his mission , but not while pondering the accusation . \\naccusing someone of murder in this situation is like \" handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 \" , as he puts it . \\nit doesn\\'t make too much sense . \\nescorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat . \\nthe men are chef ( frederic forrest ) , chief ( albert hall ) , lance johnson ( sam bottoms ) and mr . clean ( a fifteen year-old laurence fishburne ) . \\nwillard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is , but they all know it is something big . \\nthe men encounter many exciting , dangerous and bizarre situations . \\nbut no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore . \\nkilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf . \\nsurf . \\nthis is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson . \\nduvall\\'s portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific , and , he provides a number of memorable quotes . \\neventually , captain willard encounters colonel kurtz\\'s frightening community full of strange things everywhere you look , especially his followers . \\none of his main followers is a freelance photographer ( dennis hopper ) who attempts to convey the situations to willard . \\nbut willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony . \\nkurtz is actually well aware of willard\\'s mission , and refers to him as \" an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill \" . \\nyet willard is intent on completing his mission , no matter what shocking things kurtz does . \\napocalypse now , possibly one of the greatest films ever made , is a stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the vietnam war . \\na movie that will hypnotize you with it\\'s brilliant cinematography , apocalypse now is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial and horrifying ravages of war . \\ndefinitely on the \" do not miss \" list . \\nbe prepared for a very memorable film . \\n', b'the \" submarine \" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is . \\nthink about it . . . \\nthese films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public . \\nthey aren\\'t like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those . \\nand they aren\\'t like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one\\'s done any of that stuff yet . \\nwhen a new one comes out , you don\\'t hear anyone say \" ugh , another submarine movie \" like people tend to say \" ugh , another boxing movie \" . \\nlook at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide . . . \\nall are well regarded as top-notch entertainment . \\ngladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u . s . naval submarine during world war ii . \\nwe learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton ) . \\nmcconaughey\\'s crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence . \\nthe mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters . \\nthe first great thing about u-571 is the film\\'s opening sequence . \\nthe german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion . \\nit\\'s tense , exciting and fascinating . \\nand i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles . \\nmost movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away . \\nonce the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder \" ok , now how do they get out of this ? \" . \\nthe stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it\\'s a lot of fun getting there . \\ni only have two minor complaints about the entire film . \\nthe first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence . \\nwhile their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally . \\ni mean , did we really have to see the ship\\'s crew at a wedding ? \\nbecause of that , you now know exactly what\\'s going to happen to the groom ! \\nmy other gripe would be during the film\\'s finale . \\nthere\\'s an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president\\'s plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one . \\ni cannot stress this enough . . . \\nuntil a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models . \\nyes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you \" that couldn\\'t happen \" , but the overall point of this film is entertainment . \\nit succeeds fantastically . \\n[pg-13] \\n', b'i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 . \\nthe best way i can put it is that it\\'s funky . \\ni know this is an odd question , but remember the opening music of \" police academy 4 : citizens on patrol \" , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song \" citizens on patrol \" during the opening credits ? \\nit\\'s just like that . \\nanyway , part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) . \\nthis time , a group of horny teens ( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed . \\nit turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me . \\nshe\\'s the lone survivor this time . \\npart 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3-d , and from what i can tell from the video , it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects . \\njason had long , wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2 . now , one day later he\\'s completely bald . \\nalso , it being one day later , it can\\'t be friday the 13th now can it ? \\noh well . \\nsteve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series . \\n[r] \\n', b'there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor\\'s effort . \\noften a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . \\nwhen one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . \\nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with \" the hurricane . \" \\nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin \" hurricane \" carter would normally be called \" norman jewison\\'s \\'the hurricane , \\' \" as per the tradition of referring to a film \" belonging \" to a director . \\nbut though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of \" the hurricane , \" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . \\nwashington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar . \\njailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . \\nthe situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . \\nthrough the efforts of that group and carter\\'s lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . \\nthe film details carter\\'s childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . \\nwhen he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . \\ndespite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . \\nflash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . \\nthe book , entitled \" the sixteenth round , \" opens young lesra\\'s eyes to the injustice that was carter\\'s life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . \\nlesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \\n \" the hurricane \" leans on denzel washington . \\nhe must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . \\nit\\'s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . \\nit would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film . \\nthe actor\\'s work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm\\'s length . \\nwe feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . \\nwashington\\'s is a performance of weight and emotional depth . \\nhe doesn\\'t merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . \\nhis work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . \\nnorman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \\n \" the hurricane \" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . \\njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . \\nhis boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from \" raging bull , \" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . \\njewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . \\njewison\\'s best achievement in \" the hurricane \" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . \\nsadly , though , the film\\'s chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter . \\nthere is much to interest a viewer in \" the hurricane , \" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . \\ntake a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . \\ncarter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . \\nthe canadians are good . \\nthe cops are bad . \\nthe canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film\\'s failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya\\'s ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . \\nmuch of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( \" hate put me in prison . \\nlove\\'s gonna bust me out . \" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special . \\nit\\'s too bad . \\nthe cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . \\ni wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than \" he\\'s a racist pig . \" \\ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . \\nin short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . \\ncriticism has been levied against the liberties \" the hurricane \" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . \\nfor example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . \\nmost accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . \\nfurthermore , much of carter\\'s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . \\nof course , \" the hurricane \" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don\\'t remove one fact : \" the hurricane \" is a highly flawed film . \\nonly one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it\\'s a good thing \" the hurricane \" has that actor . \\ncarter has been quoted as saying , \" denzel washington is making me look good , \" but he\\'s not the only one . \\nwashington makes this film look good . \\ndenzel washington\\'s \" the hurricane . \" \\nsounds pretty good to me . \\n', b'armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . \\nstories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . \\narmageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you\\'ll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . \\nbut i loved every freaking minute of it . \\nbelieve me , i\\'m just as shocked as you are . \\nhell , i don\\'t even know why i went to see it in the first place . \\nthe previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . \\ni\\'m sorry , but \" somebody dial 911 ! ! ! \" \\nisn\\'t quite the tagging that\\'s going to sell a movie . \\nit isn\\'t too wise either to market the film using the movie\\'s stupidest lines ( \" beam me up scotty \" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) . \\ni mean , let\\'s face it ; armageddon\\'s previews rival the truman show\\'s as being some of the worst of the year . \\nneither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice . \\nof course , you all know the story . \\nwhen the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us\\'s top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) . \\nin the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . \\nbelonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who\\'s always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g\\'s . \\nalso , there\\'s the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers . \\nhe kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . \\nthen on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can\\'t quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . \\nbasically , that\\'s about it . \\nas i said , this is hardly a film about plot . \\nit\\'s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . \\ncase in point : nasa doesn\\'t know that there is even an asteroid on it\\'s way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? \\nanother example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy . \\nhow pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! ! \\nwant another one ? \\nokay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing \" leaving on a jet plane \" , and soon , all the rest join in . \\ndid michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? \\nbut naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin\\' time at the movies . \\nand don\\'t get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . \\nso even if you don\\'t win one of mcdonald\\'s free tickets , it\\'s still definitely worth checking out . \\n', b'in december of 1996 , a little movie called \" scream , \" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens . \\nfirst , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both \" scream \" movies , \" i know what you did last summer , \" \" urban legend , \" etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a \\'la \\'80s john hughes ) , starting with last june\\'s \" can\\'t hardly wait . \" \\nit may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : \" varsity blues , \" \" jawbreaker , \" \" cruel intentions , \" \" simply irresistible , \" \" the rage : carrie 2 , \" and \" the mod squad . \" \\ncoming april 9 are two more of this type : \" never been kissed \" and \" go , \" and on april 23 , we\\'ve got the teen satire \" election \" and the teen horror-comedy \" idle hands . \" \\njeesh ! \\nout of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" is this past january\\'s mediocre , ho-hum \" she\\'s all that . \" \\nalthough similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" a modern-day version of shakespeare\\'s \" the taming of the shrew \" ( \" she\\'s all that \" got its inspiration from \" pygmalion \" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985\\'s \" the breakfast club . \" \\nand to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn\\'t have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in \" she\\'s all that ? \" ) . \\nthe day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . \\nalthough he doesn\\'t know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won\\'t allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . \\nkat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \\ncomplicating matters , cameron\\'s dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . \\nas you can see , \" 10 things i hate about you \" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven\\'t even mentioned , such as kat\\'s shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca\\'s materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . \\nat a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of \" she\\'s all that , \" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , \" you\\'re vapor \" ) . \\nsince i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . \\naside from a good screenplay , it\\'s the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . \\naside from joseph gordon-levitt ( \" 3rd rock from the sun \" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . \\nas the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries \" the \\'60s \" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . \\neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat\\'s way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . \\nno one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . \\nheath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . \\none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . \\nin one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . \\none off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school\\'s staff act , which is strikingly unformal . \\nallison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl \" chill \" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . \\nalthough there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . \\nin one very funny scene , chastity asks , \" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? \" \\nat another point , bianca and kat\\'s father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it\\'s like to be pregnant . \\n \" 10 things i hate about you \" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the \\'90s . \\nit also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave \\'80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . \\nby the film\\'s end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . \\nluckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about \" 10 things i hate about you , \" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten . \\n', b\"stallone attempts to 'act' in this cop drama . \\nthe film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal , who's nephew ( played by michael rappaport ) is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths . \\nkeital dosen't really want to get involved in anything , gets rid of rappaport , and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on . \\nthis film should be brilliant . \\nit sounds like a great plot , the actors are first grade , and the supporting cast is good aswell , and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance . \\nhowever , it can't hold up . \\nalthough the acting is fantastic ( even stallone isn't bad ) the directing and story is dull and long winded \\nsome scenes go on for too long , with nothing really happening in them . \\nin fact , the only scenes that do work are action scenes , which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid . \\nin this film , serious means dull . \\nthe dialogue is warbling , and basically just repeats the same points over and over , no matter who is delivering them . \\nthe plot , which has potential , is wasted , again just being cliched after a while . \\nin fact , the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro , both delivering their usual good performances . \\nhowever , stallone , although not given much to say , gives a good performance . \\nhowever , it's not all that bad . \\nas said above , the action scenes are well done . \\ntheres also a very good ending , which uses the cinemas sound system well . \\nin fact , the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997 . \\nif only the rest of the film was as good as the ending . \\ncop land , then , turns out not to be a power house film , but a rather dull , and not every exciting film . \\nhugely disappointing , and i can't really recommend it . \\n\", b\"would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ? \\nlet me tell you what reality is . \\nreality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot . \\nthat's reality . \\namerica's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) . \\nthe plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time . \\nthe only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) . \\ngosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage . \\nveteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all . \\n ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . ) \\nand did i mention gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ? \\nand that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ? \\noh billy , you're a scamp ! \\nthe script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? \\nand bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it's not a funny one . \\nyes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces ! \\nif you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine . \\nit's about to expire . \\naside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) , \\namerica's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself . \\ni didn't time it ( the movie's not that bad ) , but it's crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film . \\nbad move , billy -- your jokes suck . \\nthe crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me . \\njulia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here . \\nobviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise . \\nnone of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho . \\nas for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work . \\nhe's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years . \\nit'll probably be another 11 before he's back again . \\ni could drone on about how america's sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old . \\ninstead , i'll settle for discussing the movie's worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment . \\nevery single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains . \\nwhen you leave the theater , you'll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ? \\n\", b\"what do you get when you rip-off good movies like woody allen's bananas and martin scorsese's after hours ? \\nyou'd think you'd get the best of both films . \\ninstead you get woo . \\nfalling in somewhere between def jam's how to be a player ( which was awful ) and booty call ( which was ok ) , woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african-americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons . \\nthe whole film plays out as a black version of after hours , as wild woman woo ( jada pinkett smith ) goes out on a blind date with straight-laced tim ( tommy davidson ) . \\nmayhem follows them . \\nfor some unknown reason ( read : contrived screenplay ) davidson puts up with all of woo's antics for the entire night , which include her destroying his bathroom mirror , stealing things from his house , violently questioning him ( accusing and belittling him actually ) about previous girlfriends , causing a riot in an elegant restaurant , and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn't tolerate . \\nbut for the sake of this bad movie ? \\nsure , why not ? \\nthere are a few chuckles in the film , the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas . \\nin this case , davidson is running from thugs , gets into a subway car as the doors are closing , starts to taunt the thugs , then the doors open back up again . \\na good joke , but a stolen one . \\nanother chuckle is provided by billy dee williams' cameo as himself . \\nmovies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so , and not one of them has ever been a hit . \\nwoo won't be one either . \\nso why was it made ? \\nand more importantly , isn't there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive ? \\neveryone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point . \\n[r] \\n\", b\"-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 :

this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . \\nthe makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . \\nthe performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . \\nso i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . \\nlonger , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] \\nthe primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . \\ntoo many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . \\nyou watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . \\nmatinee is not like that . \\ni left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . \\ni found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . \\nbut most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . \\nthe comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . \\ni believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . \\nhe is highly expressive both physically and vocally . \\ni felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . \\nthe other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . \\nthe movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . \\ni thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . \\nthey tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . \\nunfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . \\nwhile the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . \\nseveral aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . \\none example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . \\nif you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . \\nanother reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . \\none of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . \\n ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) \\nwhile mant ! \\nnever got made , many films like it were , and mant ! \\nserves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . \\nso again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . \\nthis isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . \\nenjoy ! \\n\", b'reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy , \" analyze this , \" i asked myself , \" how could this miss ? \" \\nrobert de niro ( \" taxi driver , \" \" raging bull \" ) , billy crystal ( \" city slickers \" ) , lisa kudrow ( \" the opposite of sex \" ) , and director harold ramis ( \" national lampoon\\'s vacation \" ) . \\nthese are usually reliable filmmakers ( well , okay , crystal has been in a sizable slump lately ) , and tellingly , the first half-hour of \" analyze this \" was very funny . \\nunfortunately , as the running time ticked away , i began to think that the first thirty minutes had , unbeknownst to me , been rewound and were being replayed another two-and-a-half times . \\nthe film has obtained a clever premise , but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen . \\nmiddle-aged psychoanalyst ben sobel\\'s ( billy crystal ) life is finally going very well . \\nalthough he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents , especially his father , who is also a psychiatrist , ben has an easy-going teenage son ( kyle sabihy ) and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend , laura ( lisa kudrow ) . \\nin little but a flash , however , ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro ) , who desperately wants counseling , even though he himself won\\'t even admit to having anxiety attacks . \\nben tries to help paul , mostly so he will get him off his back , but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding , which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death . \\nit seems to ben that no matter what he does , paul vitti will not go away , and the more they become involved , the more ben\\'s potentially happy life gets into danger . \\n \" analyze this \" has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half ) , but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan , ramis , and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time . \\nadmittedly , de niro is very funny here ( and i can\\'t remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them , including a substantial plotline . \\nsince \" analyze this \" bills not one , not two , but three writers , you\\'d think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot . \\none of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters , all of which have next to nothing to do and aren\\'t even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop . \\ncoming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year\\'s best films , \" clockwatchers \" and \" the opposite of sex , \" lisa kudrow\\'s throwaway \" girlfriend \" role is an incredible step down . \\nsure , kudrow\\'s fellow \" friend \" jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in \" office space , \" but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston . \\nkudrow , meanwhile , mostly just stands around , no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place . \\nchazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fares even worse , in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character . \\nfinally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on \" saturday night live \" ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal\\'s patients and then completely disappears . \\ntoo bad , considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal . \\nonce \" analyze this \" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow\\'s laura standing alone at the altar once again , i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone , and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most , ben . \\nafterwards , the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul , became a real laugh-free dead-zone , losing its last remaining comic punches . \\n \" analyze this \" proves that talent can certainly help any film out , but when the written material isn\\'t up to their level , what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air . \\n', b'the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates . \\ngeez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! \\nsorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies . \\nthe pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in \" absolutely fabulous \" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery . \\nneedless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder\\'s legs ! \\nbut despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i\\'ve now seen the film a couple of times now , that \" hobbling \" scene was no less disturbing ! \\ni\\'m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! \\nthat may be the most memorable scene , but it\\'s certainly not the only worth watching . \\nstephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale . \\nit\\'s a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) . \\nrescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer\\'s \" number one fan \" , he soon becomes her prisoner . \\nboth the script and kathy bates\\' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) . \\nbates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . \\nat times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she\\'s a rather tragic character , and more often than not she\\'s just damned scary ! \\nthis is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . \\nit\\'s an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it\\'s basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it\\'s a remarkable piece of cinema . \\nthere are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner\\'s stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . \\noh , i haven\\'t really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who\\'s a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . \\nbut , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . \\nalong with the pig , of course ! \\nanyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . \\nthere\\'s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine . \\nhe succeeds , but . . . she \\nknocks the glass over ! \\ni bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! \\nin the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \" d\\'oh ! ! \" \\nother nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house . \\nwe cut to annie in her car - she\\'s on her way home . . . he \\nrealises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut \\nto the car again , she\\'s getting near . . . will he make it ? \\nok , so these sequences aren\\'t exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! \\nboy , do they work ! \\nif a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it\\'s doing something right ! \\nof course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \" hobbling \" ! \\nannie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she\\'s going to stop him once and for all . \\ncue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it ! \\nnasty . \\nit all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! \\nand then we\\'re given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i\\'ve ever seen . \\nshe gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won\\'t die ! \\nsheldon isn\\'t in terribly good shape either . \\nif it weren\\'t so gorey it would almost be laughable . \\nbut it\\'s a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked . \\nmisery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller . \\nthe directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem . \\nwonderful stuff . \\n

\\n', b'robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people . \\nin \" the natural \" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be \" the best there ever was , \" but still acted like a humble farm boy . \\nin \" butch cassidy and the sundance kid \" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer . \\neven in \" indecent proposal \" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love . \\nin his latest film , \" the horse whisperer , \" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . \\nredford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . \\ndespite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase \" horse whisperer \" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . \\nbooker\\'s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . \\nthe accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace\\'s friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace\\'s horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . \\nannie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . \\nat first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn\\'t work . \\ninstead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . \\nin many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . \\nthe move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it\\'s hard not to see annie and grace\\'s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . \\nin \" the horse whisperer , \" country is clearly the victor . \\nthe city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace\\'s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie\\'s controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . \\nredford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed \" a river runs through it \" six years ago . \\nin many ways , \" the horse whisperer \" comes from the same poetic vein as \" river , \" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains . \\nbut then , that would ruin the magic . \\nmuch of the film\\'s photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . \\nto further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( \" natural born killers , \" \" platoon \" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . \\nin terms of the story itself , \" the horse whisperer \" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean\\'s \" a brief encounter \" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood\\'s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller\\'s \" the bridges of madison county \" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted \" bridges \" ) . \\nalthough \" the horse whisperer \" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . \\nit seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who\\'s being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is . \\nin \" the horse whisperer , \" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill . \\nhe plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . \\nhe is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . \\nthere is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . \\nit shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . \\nas they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . \\nit\\'s a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie\\'s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . \\nafter all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . \\nthe best scenes in \" the horse whisperer \" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . \\nalthough booker\\'s horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . \\nthese are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . \\nat some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . \\nnevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . \\nthere are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . \\nalthough the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make \" the horse whisperer \" worth the price of admission . \\n', b'_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . \\nmitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . \\nbut as the trailer goes , \" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . \" \\nso he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . \\nthis should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . \\nin fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam\\'s father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . \\nso for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a \\nheart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . \\nnot that there isn\\'t a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . \\nthere are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam\\'s impotent father\\'s ongoing lust for them . \\nand for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america\\'s_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . \\nbut the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? \\nthe answer is a resounding no . \\nit\\'s not that macdonald isn\\'t a funny guy . \\nhe was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn\\'t hurt that he\\'s a natural , likable screen presence . \\nhe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don\\'t work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . \\nstill , macdonald\\'s few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . \\nthe late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . \\nsaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . \\nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . \\ncome to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . \\n', b'one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids . \\nalthough black-and-white films are frequently viewed as suspect , ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind . \\nand if you can find a colorful action film , even if it is from six decades ago , then there is a real possibility of a take home hit . \\nso it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood , a high spirited version of the walter scott story . \\nnominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold\\'s melodramatic music , ralph dawson\\'s fast paced editing and carl jules weyl\\'s lush sets , the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn\\'s charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley , a . k . a . robin hood . \\nflynn , with his handsome figure and toothy smile , charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself . \\nlet me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household . \\nthe littlest rhodes , jeffrey , age 8 , liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more . \\ni\\'ll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review . \\nsimply stated , the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre , the swashbuckler . \\nrobin , with a smile from ear-to-ear , fights off a hundred men without a scratch . \\nalthough the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930\\'s james bond , the production values and the acting raise it above that level . \\nrobin hood is a classic story of rich and poor . \\nrobin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows . \\nin this movie , however , he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country . \\nrobin , with his courage and athletic skills , serves as a role model for kids . \\nand with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy-eyed lady marian fitzswalter , the story has heavy romantic overtones . \\nfilmed in the typical , richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor , the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties , which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players . \\nin scene after scene the picture charms the audience . \\nwho wouldn\\'t fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest , even if the outcome is so clearly preordained . \\nand , of course , he doesn\\'t just win , he does so by splitting the other man\\'s arrow . \\nwatching the picture today does provide some jarring moments . \\nsherlock holmes as the villain , sir guy of gisbourne , for example , just doesn\\'t seem right , even if basil rathbone did have a real-life identity outside of his most famous role . \\nand then there are those wigs from the makeup department -- so bad , they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy . \\nas was popular in the cinema of that era , people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty , bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks . \\nbad guys are banished rather than killed , and lovers go off hand-in-hand , doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing . \\nthe result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful , cartoonish figures . \\nhollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore , so try to savor the old ones when you can . \\nthe adventures of robin hood runs 1 : 42 . \\nit is not rated , but containing absolutely nothing offensive , it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages . \\njeffrey thinks the film is \" great \" and gives it * * * * . \\nhe recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures -- he hates the sight of blood in movies . \\nhis favorite parts are the battles and the ending , and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ( ian hunter ) . \\n', b'disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan . \\nwhile it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . \\nfa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it\\'s \\njust that she doesn\\'t quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . \\nwhile most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind . \\nbut there is trouble on the horizon . \\nthe evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china . \\nthe emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . \\nthe only male in mulan\\'s family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate . \\nmulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father\\'s life . . . by \\nsecretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield . \\nmulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d . \\nwong , singing : donny osmond ) . \\nbut she\\'s not alone in her tasks . . . in \\ntypical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized \" guardian \" dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . \\nmuch like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn\\'t flow well with the rest of the more serious story . \\nsure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it . \\nthe overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience . \\nbut , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . \\nthe animation is on par with some of disney\\'s best . \\nthe story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring . \\nthe musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney\\'s recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable . \\nat least , we\\'re only subjected to four of them this time around . \\nmulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . \\nmost of the killing is off-screen and it\\'s all highly depersonalized ( there\\'s nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi\\'s mom ) . \\nthere\\'s nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . \\nchildren will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . \\nit\\'s ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . \\nif the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands . \\ninstead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies . \\n', b\"well , i know that stallone is 50 years old now , but in daylight he doesn't look it ! \\ndaylight is a great disaster movie . \\nif you've seen cliffhanger , you'll know stallone's character already . \\na guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time . \\na tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste . \\na dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! ) \\nstallone , a former emergency medical service man , is chauffeuring a rich couple around , when they reach the outside of the tunnel , before the explosion . \\nthen , 30 minutes into the movie , boom ! \\n>from here on , the plot takes a back seat , and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged . \\nmost all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat . \\nthere are a few melodramatic parts here , but , they tend to work out well . \\nthere is no general antagonist in this film , but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that . \\ndaylight is a great film , i saw a non-matinee showing of it , and i thought it was worth every penny . \\nthe characterizations are mostly flat , one dimesional , but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters . \\nrob cohen ( dragonheart ) does a great job with this film . \\n\", b\"arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar , go to the movies , fall in love , move in together , etc . \\nreview ====== \\nwell , if you haven't seen when harry met sally or he said , she said , or if you don't watch love & war on television , you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages . \\nhowever , if you've seen any of these , than you have seen most of this film . \\nthis of course doesn't mean its bad . \\nsome of it is amusing , but overall , i just had to ask what's the point ? \\narye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love . \\nkevin pollack is the stereotypical female-fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes , most if which weren't very funny . \\ncouteney cox is the stereotypical career-minded woman who falls in love . \\njulie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman . \\n ( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical . \\nthis film uses a lot of formula , the plot is basically known from the opening credits . ) \\nso what is good about the movie ? \\nwell as i said there are a few amusing moments . \\nsurprisingly , julie brown , who i usually find just plain goofy , was the best thing in the film . \\nalso there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual . \\ngee , this is really short . \\nnot much to say about the film really . \\nit is just kind of there . \\nwatching it on video might not be a complete waste of time , but i wouldn't recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre . \\n\", b'remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? \\n \" pulp fiction \" and \" fargo \" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . \\nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing \" the way of the gun \" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be\\'s but upon closer inspection doesn\\'t look like anything comprehendable . \\nit\\'s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won\\'t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . \\ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone who\\'s familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote \" the usual suspects , \" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . \\nthat film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . \\nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that \" if it\\'s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . \" \\nwith \" the way of the gun \" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . \\nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren\\'t hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . \\nthey get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . \\nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . \\nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the \" bag man \" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he\\'s doing ) . \\nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can\\'t call the authorities for help . \\nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers\\' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . \\nthe exec\\'s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . \\nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . \\nmcquarrie doesn\\'t know the meaning of the word simple . \\nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . \\neverything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it\\'s to the point of surrealism . \\nnothing is what it seems in this reality , it\\'s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry\\'s rules and regulations . \\nevery scene with caan\\'s character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about \" the business \" and how it works and we\\'re hardly given a clue as to what they\\'re talking about . \\nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they\\'re more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet\\'s trash . \\nno one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . \\nit\\'s like a dream without any appeal . \\ntake the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . \\nthey sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don\\'t move . \\nthe guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . \\nyou\\'d think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don\\'t , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . \\nthere\\'s a lot of things i didn\\'t understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn\\'t some yuppie or old rich snob , he\\'s like a hippie straight out of the 60s . \\nsecondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . \\nlastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country\\'s army . \\nif they were suicidal they wouldn\\'t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . \\nthere\\'s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . \\nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . \\nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . \\nand it\\'s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . \\nwith any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . \\ni can\\'t say either for \" the way of the gun , \" because it has very little going for it and i can\\'t imagine anyone intelligently defending it . \\n', b\"dr dolittle ( 20th century fox ) running time : 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor ( 1996 ) , murphy returns in this abysmal comedy . \\nhe plays doctor john dolittle , who as a child had the ability to understand animals . \\nhowever , after being 'exorcised' he loses this ability , and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people ( most notably dr mark weller , played by oliver platt . ) \\nhowever , with a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns , and 'comedy' is ready and waiting to happen . \\nexcept comedy never does happen . \\ndoctor dolittle , even with the excellent premise , rarely manages to raise a laugh . \\npoor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie , and his performance suffers . \\nthe manic murphy we saw in the 80's is gone , his more mature ( and more boring ) twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90's . \\nthe voices of the animals , which include albert brooks , chris rock ( the 'new' eddie murphy ) and norm mcdonald as 'lucky' the dog are marginally better , and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie . \\nsadly , most of their lines are pretty dumb . \\nand they're not 'funny' dumb , like dumb & dumber ( 1994 ) , but just boring dumb . \\nthe film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through , in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs . \\nthere are a few good jokes in the script , but they are few and far between . \\nif i had to choose a favourite performance , it would probably be albert brooks tiger , who has a certain charm about him . \\nsadly , he's barely in the movie , and rock's really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time . \\njoke wise , we are thankfully , spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor . \\nthe director , betty thomas , has , well , done better films . \\nshe bought us private parts ( 1997 ) and the brady bunch movie ( 1995 ) which were , sadly , much better than this . \\nthe scenes lack any charm , she just gets the job done . \\nthe animals themselves , are reasonable realistic , although most of them are obviously puppets . \\nthere's an impressive looking tiger , however , and the lip sync is pretty good . \\nyou'd have no problem guessing that most of the close up's are puppets , however , with their jilted movement . \\ni was hoping jim hensons workshop , who created the furry friends , would have done a better job . \\ndoctor dolittle , in the end , is a disappointment for everyone involved . \\nmurphy has done much better movies ( i . e \\ntrading places ) the director has seen better days , and even the creatures aren't that good . \\nthe target audience , aged between 7-13 , who are undemanding , will probably like it however , thanks to it's dumbed down humour . \\neveryone else , however , should give doctor dolittle a miss . \\n\", b\"in the first death wish movie , mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife . \\nin the second , he was avenging his daughter . \\nin the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend . \\nfourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz . \\nhowever , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for . \\nthis time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways . \\nkersey's new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren't the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers . \\neven such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter . \\nwhite's plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them . \\nthe plan begins to take shape , but kersey's actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) . \\nfourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade . \\nhowever , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much effort in his acting . \\nhowever , the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring . \\nthere are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end . \\nthe script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years . \\nthere are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson's 1970s classics . \\n ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) . \\n\", b'i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on . \\ni\\'m big fan of perry\\'s subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley\\'s on-edge , extreme acting was a riot . \\nso naturally , when the trailer for \" almost heroes \" hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down . \\na soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley\\'s final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry\\'s big breakthrough . \\ni was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley\\'s best , in spite of david spade\\'s absence . \\ni was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran . \\nsadly , none of this came to pass . \\nthe humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between . \\nperry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it\\'s his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with . \\nand the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it\\'s a farley flick . \\nthe movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second . \\nperry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley . \\nand farley\\'s classic humor is widespread , too . \\nalmost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot . \\nguys , let\\'s leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ? \\nstick to \" tommy boy \" , and we\\'ll all be \" friends \" . \\n', b'roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , \" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . \\nben kingsley ? \" \\nmy response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . \\nthey should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . \\nthe same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . \\nthat is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . \\ngary \" gal \" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . \\nlife has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . \\nbut his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . \\nthe first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . \\nthe second punch comes from gal\\'s past . \\nback in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv\\'s lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . \\nhe sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . \\ndon will accept any decision gal makes from \" yes \" to \" certainly . \" \\nhowever , if gal says \" no \" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy\\'s ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . \\nin the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody\\'s skin . \\nkingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . \\nthere are some serious problems in louis mellis\\'s and david scinto\\'s script that should have been caught before filming . \\nwhen we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . \\nbeyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . \\nany local hood could have done what gal is needed for . \\nadditionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . \\nno only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . \\nin spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . \\ni know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . \\nthe story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . \\nthe old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . \\nit is not a great plot . \\nin sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . \\nperhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . \\nit is an old plot dressed up to look new . \\nif the plot is old , at least the style is creative . \\nthis is director jonathan glazer\\'s first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . \\nhis style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . \\ncinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . \\nwe see one side of a person\\'s faces . \\nbut the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . \\nhalf of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . \\nus yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . \\nat least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . \\nsexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . \\nthe plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . \\nfurther respectability comes from ben kingsley\\'s high-powered performance . \\ni give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n', b' \" gattaca \" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it\\'s a genre picture that doesn\\'t rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story . \\nthe movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction . \\nthis allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they\\'d like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects . \\nthose made the old-fashioned way are labeled as \" in-valids \" and confined to the lower rung of society . \\nvincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton . \\nfed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation . \\neveryday , he watches as \" superior \" folk make his fantasy a reality . \\ndetermined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids . \\nhis counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life . \\nfor a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card . \\nbecause of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she\\'s enamored by his flawless persona she doesn\\'t know is a lie . \\nbut on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered . \\ntwo ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate\\'s loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent\\'s eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent\\'s cover and derail his goal . \\neven if \" gattaca \" were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film\\'s look is dazzling without ever being flashy . \\nfirst-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama \" the truman show \" ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance . \\nan opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily . \\nniccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way . \\nwhen it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless . \\nethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level . \\nhis chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting\\'s clinical chill . \\nas the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it\\'s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core . \\nin \" gattaca \" \\'s series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful . \\nthings get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent\\'s relationship with his brother comes back into view . \\nthe big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed . \\nstill , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it\\'s successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it\\'s a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it\\'s a futuristic fable without blood and guts . \\neven its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage . \\nalthough it\\'s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , \" gattaca \" serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film . \\n', b\"an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices . \\nthat's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow . \\nthat aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source . \\nthe acting in particular i found very good , the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie . \\na few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone , yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better . \\non the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot . \\nthe character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing . \\nas far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener . \\nall these people acted their parts admirably , as for the part that sharon stone played , she played it well but the part was not utilized enough . \\nthe directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie , this is one of those occasions . \\nmatthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ) . \\nthere is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this . \\nthe one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing , the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it . \\ni certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it . \\nall in all i found this movie boring and very slow , the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch . \\nalthough there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them . \\ni wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie . \\n\", b'disney\\'s 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with , well , the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center . \\ngreat wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can\\'t quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack . \\n ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy . \\nsome lack lyrical snap . \\nothers need more memorable melodies . \\nboring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? ) \\nso , hercules is a bit of a long sit , but you won\\'t stay bored . \\nthe highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( \" somebody call ix-i-i \" ) and pop references ( \" let\\'s get ready to rumble ! \" ) a la aladdin , and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse\\'s marketing and merchandising depart- ments . \\nwhile not as rock-solid as hunchback , it\\'s a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas . \\ndirected by ron clements and john musker , with voice credits including tate donovan , susan egan , bob goldthwait , matt frewer , samantha eggar , paul shaffer , and , as lighting bolt zeus , rip torn , who\\'s having a very good summer , also appearing in trial and error and men in black . \\n', b\"no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . \\nevent horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . \\nit is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . \\nthe magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . \\nthe story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . \\nthe event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . \\nthe ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . \\na search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . \\nthe designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . \\nevent horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . \\nwhile in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . \\nthe story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! \\ni can't stand this anymore ! ' . \\nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . \\nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . \\neven so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . \\ndirector paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . \\nthis picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . \\nalthough on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . \\nhowever , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . \\nmy friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . \\ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . \\nbe forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . \\nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! \\nevent horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! \\nit has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . \\n\", b\"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . \\nearlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . \\nand now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . \\nstarring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . \\nbesson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . \\nat first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . \\nafter seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . \\nwith the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making . \\na timeless epic it is not . \\nbesson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands . \\non the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . \\nthere is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . \\njovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . \\njovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . \\nshe is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . \\njovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . \\nquite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble . \\nthe script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . \\nfaye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' . \\nall three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . \\nthe battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' . \\nthere's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . \\neven his fellow troopers are petrified . \\n`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story . \\nalmost too 90's , it seems . \\nthere's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' \\nsprinkled throughout the screenplay . \\ni was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . \\nthere's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . \\nit seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . \\nthe musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . \\nif it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . \\nbut the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . \\nduring these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . \\nit's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . \\n`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the

george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls . \\nyou see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it . \\nthis one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george . \\nclarence has got his own problems , however . \\nclarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by . \\nthe bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel . \\nbut before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey\\'s life . \\nwe see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother\\'s life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else . \\nwhen the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn\\'t sold to the evil mr . potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls . \\none christmas , potter gets his chance . \\nuncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank\\'s money . \\nwithout the money , the bank must close down . \\ngeorge is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide . \\nclarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george . \\nthis is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about . \\nit\\'s a wonderful life does have its faults . \\nthe movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men . \\nthe sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90\\'s , like something out of a revisionist look . \\nall the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film . \\nthere are , however , endearing moments in all of this . \\ncapra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50\\'s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable . \\nthe story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish . \\nthere\\'s this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody . \\nit\\'s a little too nice for my liking , at times . \\nthere is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult . \\nbut watching it\\'s a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it\\'s always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done . \\ncapra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection . \\ndonna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr . potter . \\neveryone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen ) . \\nthere is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that . \\nstewart , however , is the king of all of this . \\nhe is sometimes awkward , especially when saying \" merry christmas \" to all objects , animate or inanimate . \\nbut he is james stewart , and he\\'s lovably delightful throughout the film . \\nhave i complained ? \\ni shouldn\\'t have . \\nthis is a really good movie . \\nno , this is a great movie . \\nbetter yet , this is a phenomenal movie . \\nthere is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life . \\nthis is one of those films . \\nit is a \" feel-good \" movie , something people complain a little too much about . \\nbut capra\\'s reworking of \" a christmas carol \" is the greatest christmas movie of all time . \\nthere , i\\'ve said it . \\ni have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister . \\nthey all loved it . \\nthey loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending . \\nis it a little too sugar-coated ? \\nmaybe . \\nno matter . \\nthis is a film that should be watched time and time again , with families around a coffee table , and eggnog on the plate . \\nit is a film that just makes you feel good about life , family , and hope . \\nit is the perfect christmas film , flaws and all . \\nit is frank capra\\'s greatest acheivement , and that really does say a lot . \\nfor about 121 out of 129

henry , who no sooner has the film started , is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon . \\nas part of his alliance with france , he requests the hand-in-marriage to the queen of normandy ( joan sims ) . \\nshe comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath , he is totally averse to the idea of marriage . \\nhenry's court is very corrupt , with the cardinal ( terry scott ) trying to bribe cromwell ( kenneth williams ) and cromwell trying to bribe the king . \\nthere is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen ( sims ) in the tower of london ready for execution . \\nthe queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before , so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey , who has a rather lecherous character to play this time . \\nthe cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices ! \\nowing to circumstances , sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isn't . \\nthis is because of renewed threats by the king of france ( peter gilmore ) to come over himself , which in the end he does . \\nby then , henry has found himself a new queen , played by none other than barbara windsor ! \\nit looks like he has some explaining to do ! \\nthere are stand-out performances by sid james as henry , joan sims as marie , and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal . \\nalso there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth , who plays barbara's father . \\nthe set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good . \\nthere is even an early appearance from david prowse , who later became the green cross code man and darth vader . \\nthe film does have it's downsides though , as it is getting pretty routine for the carry-on team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly . \\nthere is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw , who could have helped the film along . \\nhowever , overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes , so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only , but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone's while to sit down and watch it . \\n\", b\"with storytelling this compelling , who needs books ? \\nbased on the book by author james ellroy , l . a . confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years . \\ntogether with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle , the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film , resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight , an atom would have to squeeze itself through . \\nset in the 50s , the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities . \\njack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style , concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention . \\nthere is also the young hot-shot rookie , ed exley ( pearce ) , fresh out of the academy and all-out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father . \\nthe tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe ) , a cop who believes in justice , the swift and violent way . \\n3 policemen , distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil . \\nwhen his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation , bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder . \\neven after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case , happenings began to link itself to the murder . \\nthe 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised-crime in hollywood . \\nthe last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects . \\nin l . a . confidential , you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story' going for it . \\nthere is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all . \\nsurprisingly , though spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise vincennes , the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns' , pearce and crowe . \\npearce's exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance . \\ncrowe's bud white is the most impressive of all ; head-strong and temperamental , he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here . \\nsuperb acting . , wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever . \\neasily the best hollywood piece for 1997 . \\n\", b'most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy . \\nrocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category , but manages to be slightly unique . \\nthe rocky formula of \" rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight \" is carried out to the letter . \\nalso the \\'tradition\\' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well . \\nthis movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky ( sylvester stallone ) has become . . . \\neven showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! ! \\nthen it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips ( hulk hogan ) . \\na mysterious bad-ass known as clubber lang ( mr . t ) trash-talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he \" pities the fool \" for not coming out and fighting him outright . \\nrocky\\'s trainer ( burgess meredith ) tells rocky not to fight , but the italian stallion doesn\\'t listen . \\nnaturally , he gets his ass kicked . \\nsomewhere along the line after this several things happen . \\nrocky\\'s longtime trainer dies , causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed . \\nrocky\\'s wife complains to her husband that he should fight . \\nthe final fight ensues between clubber and rocky . \\nguess who wins ? \\nthe winner\\'s name rhymes with \\'smocky\\' . \\nthe movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang\\'s over the top performance . \\nthe dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film . \\nwhich is good if you like fighting scenes . \\nthe last match is quite decent actually . \\nif you liked the previous films , rent this one . \\nit\\'s well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series . \\nbut if you can\\'t stand rocky shouting \" adrianne ! ! ! \" \\none more time , see something else . \\n', b'you don\\'t want to be like mike . \\nmike has been doing badly . \\nembarrassingly bad . \\nhe broke up a six-year relationship six months ago to move from n . y . to l . a . and he\\'s still not over her . \\nas a result , his jokes fall flat when he tries to impress , and he\\'s a comedian . \\nwell , an unemployed comedian , one of hollywood\\'s little fish , and it has gotten so bad he\\'s asked for an application at starbuck\\'s . \\nactually , the starbuck\\'s thing gets even worse . \\nand worse . \\nyou won\\'t fail to like mike , however , played endearingly by jon favreau . \\nswingers revolves around mike\\'s half-hearted and awkward efforts to get back in the social swing of things . \\nto this end he is enthusiastically assisted by his equally underachieving twentysomething actor friends , such as trent ( vince vaughn with the film\\'s most animated performance ) , who has the gift of gab bordering on the disturbing side of motivational speaking , gun-toting sue ( patrick van horn ) , and rob ( ron livingston ) , who once played hamlet but now longs to work as goofy in disneyland , but doesn\\'t succeed because of his lack of \" theme park experience . \" \\ntogether they talk about women - how to make eye contact , which involves avoiding it , and when to call so as never to appear desperate , two days being \" industry standard . \" \\nafter talking the talk , they walk the walk , strutting like the cool swingers they aspire to be , always to laughable effect . \\nto get mike out of his funk , his friends persistently convince him to get outside , whether it be to a quickie night trip to a seedy vegas casino or a cutthroat hollywood party with the beautiful people or a 50s swing lounge . \\neverywhere they encourage mike to look for a replacement \" honey \" and then keep vigil over his progress , or lack of it . \\nlike dotty doting parents , mike never leaves their company without being the recipient of their confidence cheerleading ( \" you\\'re money , mike , and the honeys know it . \" ) or equipped with their eccentric dating philosophies , such as an analogy of flirting with the bear and the bunny . \\nwith the unwavering support of friends like these , maybe mike\\'s not doing too badly after all . \\nfavreau also doubled as the film\\'s screenwriter , and he proves he has the gift for creating engaging characters and witty banter that goes beyond today\\'s bon mot . \\nthere is a reassuring honesty to the friendships , even when it hits its low points and the friends commiserate . \\nwhen mike gets the gumption to look for love , you will join his cheerleading section as well . \\nswingers is light , unassuming fare , sweet candy you will want to bust your gut with - laughing - again and again . \\n', b'ingredients : pouring rain , small flooded town , damn about to burst , bad guys going after millions of dollars \\nsynopsis : at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church . \\nhe replies something like : \" the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire . \\nwell , the fire wasn\\'t that bad , since , while the church was burning , looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows . \" \\nin hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding . \\neveryone has had to evacuate because it\\'s raining , and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break . \\nenter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver named tom ( christian slater ) . \\nsuddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters . \\ntom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money , hide it , and swim for his life . \\nthis makes for an action movie full of jet skis , speedboat chases , and gun battles , as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call . \\nhe is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen ( minnie driver ) . \\nbut unknown to tom and karen , the national guard never heard tom\\'s initial distress call . \\nwill tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters ? \\nopinion : don\\'t expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics . \\nthere\\'s not much more to this movie than hiding , running , swimming , shooting , and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning , but that\\'s what makes it escapist and fun . \\nrelax , take your shoes off , and break out the popcorn . \\n', b'there seem to be two reactions to dark city . \\nyou either love it or you are unimpressed . \\ncount me as a \" love it . \" \\nas good as the crow and spawn are , dark city is better . \\nwhere the former two have a specific comic-book following , the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal . \\nit has a similar look to the others , but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent . \\nnot clever or complex , the story is still fascinating , like a selection from the twilight zone . \\na man ( rufus sewell ) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe . \\nsurprised , the attacker runs off . \\nthe dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman\\'s body in the room . \\na mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately , so he packs some clothes and leaves , never sure why he\\'s leaving or what he\\'s fleeing . \\nghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city , hounding him like figures in a nightmare . \\nan odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i . d . \\nthe amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch . \\nnow if only he could remember the rest of his life . . . . \\ndark city is good on many levels . \\nfirst , the look of the movie is excellent . \\ngive credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements . \\nthere are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements . \\nit is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper\\'s painting , nighthawks . \\nproyas\\' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film\\'s world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) . \\nthe look is like a cross between tim burton\\'s batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay . \\nsecond , the editing of the film is good . \\nthe pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the \" amnesia \" explained , in satisfying increments . \\nalso , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look . \\nthird , the special effects are well used . \\nthey look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job . \\none example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically . \\na simple ripple effect is used . \\na more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous . \\nrestraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive . \\nfinally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance . \\nunlike gattaca , the story is just open-ended and non-literal enough to be successful . \\njohn murdoch\\'s recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night , and the hopeful coming of the dawn . \\nhis struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind ( at least in his world ) . \\nwhen we finally see the big picture of the movie\\'s world , it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle . \\na few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave , but i do strongly recommend it , for its look , its pace , its story , and its timelessness . \\n', b'satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . \\n \" dr . \\nstrangelove \" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . \\n \" men in black \" ) . \\nwhat\\'s unique about \" wag the dog \" is that it doesn\\'t necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . \\nthe result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . \\nif there\\'s anything that affects americans the most it\\'s politics and showbusiness . \\nin this age of information and technology , we\\'ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it\\'s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . \\nwe need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . \\nthis film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn\\'t someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? \\nthat\\'s the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president\\'s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . \\nbrean , along with the president\\'s top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . \\nthey pitch him an idea to \" produce \" the image of a war with albania ( it\\'s a country no one\\'s heard of so they people will buy it ) . \\nsoon the wheels are in motion and the film\\'s riffing satire comes into play . \\nwe\\'re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . \\nthe initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . \\nthe characters\\' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . \\nfor example , one scene shows motss and brean\\'s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . \\nmotss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . \\nsince it\\'s all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . \\nthis demonstrates the film\\'s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . \\nbut then there\\'s the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress\\'s name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , \" this is nothing ! \" \\nby the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . \\nthe first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . \\nevery ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it\\'s always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . \\nthe screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . \\nhowever , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . \\nas the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . \\nwhat had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . \\nstill , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . \\nwillie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . \\ntruly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and \" wag the dog \" at least succeeds in this respect . \\nhowever , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . \\nthen again , it\\'s a valiant effort . \\n', b'studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it\\'s a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn\\'t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film . \\nare we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? \\n \" 54 \" belongs in the elite group of films known as \" the big disappointments \" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . \\ni was heavily awaiting \" 54 , \" not the least because i\\'ve become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that\\'s been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this \" edgy \" film . \\nperhaps more importantly , \" 54 \" is part of the blossoming subgenre , \" the 70s nostalgia film , \" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with \" boogie nights \" and \" the last days of disco \" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from \" boogie nights , \" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others . \\n \" 54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that\\'s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . \\nthis is a definite plus . \\nhere\\'s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . \\nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let\\'s look at how it all affected the people . \\nbut this film doesn\\'t let that happen . \\nit gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o\\'shea ( ryan phillippe , from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , who\\'s chief character trait is the fact that he\\'s from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . \\nhe\\'s dim-witted , into being part of \" the scene , \" and soon finds he\\'s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a \\nbit like \" saturday night fever , \" \\'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . \\npoor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . \\nshane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from \" clueless \" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . \\nalthough he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that\\'s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . \\nthe film\\'s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . \\nrubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . \\nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who\\'ve only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . \\nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that he\\'s a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . \\nhis story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . \\nit\\'s as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . \\nthe studio\\'s recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . \\nsome people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film\\'s tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini\\'s \" la dolce vita \" ) , and when i watched \" 54 , \" i didn\\'t particularly want to stay . \\n', b'ingredients : lost parrot trying to get home , friends \\nsynopsis : a russian janitor named misha ( tony shalhoub ) discovers a little old parrot languishing in the basement of

the local pound , a victim of neglect . \\nmy sister owns a real paulie : it thinks like a parrot , bites like a parrot , and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant . \\nplease think twice before buying one . \\nokay . back to the story . \\nin movies , parrots usually play support characters , but paulie might be the first movie where the ( animatronic ) bird gets main billing . \\npaulie , like those side characters in disney cartoons , is cute and sassy , a strutting , miniature human . \\nactually , paulie is the voice of jay mohr ( he played jennifer aniston\\'s boyfriend on picture perfect ) doing his best buddy hackett impression ( which is interesting , since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner , and mohr doubles as a customer ) . \\npaulie is for kids . \\nwhile watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a \" stupid furball . \" \\nsometimes , however , there are statements the kids don\\'t

version of lassie , bambi , or babe , but he\\'ll do . \\nsometimes the wisecracks go over their heads , but i\\'m sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a little person ( paulie ) trying to get

space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes . \\nhe is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors . \\noh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? \\nkewl ! \\ncritique : despite this film not looking like a \" tim burton movie \" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare . \\nalthough the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations . \\ni mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! \\ni also have to \" give it up \" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well . \\ni especially enjoyed bonham carter\\'s performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth\\'s bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part . \\nplot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest . \\ni was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of \" human beings as animals \" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film . \\ni also hated the \" kid \" character who just got on my nerves and didn\\'t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won\\'t ruin it here but c\\'mon guys . . . you \\ncoulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) . \\nbut the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests . \\nthis dude didn\\'t seem to give a rat\\'s ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn\\'t really care about what happened to him either . \\nnow i\\'m not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it . \\nvisually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton . \\nthe \" surprise ending \" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn\\'t really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) . \\nso overall , i loved the whole \" feel \" of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn\\'t appreciate the film\\'s lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring . \\nbut i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise . \\nps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn\\'t at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he\\'s suddenly been thrust ( \" this is a mad house ! \" - \\ntype of thing ) . \\nthe guy in this film barely seems to be \" put off \" by the fact that he\\'s surrounded by apes who can speak english ! ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nthe arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars

\\nsynopsis : in this loving film portrayal of an idyllic and pivotal time that a young boy spends with grandpa and grandma , the self recollections of an unseen narrator focus on his world view as a tennessee orphan boy learning of his heritage through his grandparents . \\nthe setting is after the first world war , during the great depression years . \\na nine-year-old orphan named little tree ( joseph ashton ) is taken in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his caucasian moonshiner grandpa ( james cromwell ) and his native american grandma ( tantoo cardinal ) in the wilderness of the mountains of tennessee . \\nhere little tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life - - and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise . \\neverything is miraculous to a child . \\nbut it all comes crashing down for the boy when the u . s . government forcibly takes custody away from grandpa and grandma , and forces little tree to attend the notched gap boarding school , a kind of internment camp where multiracial cherokee kids are indoctrinated to dress , pray , speak , and think like white people or face solitary confinement and corporeal punishment . \\nthrough his childhood experiences , little tree learns lessons about love , race , life , death , people , nature , and folk wisdom . \\nopinion : this excellent , excellent family movie . \\nit is one of those priceless screen gems that nobody knows about because it's not highly advertised . \\nyou won't find any formula schlock , cutesy characters , canned spirituality , sequel teasers or commercial tie ins , but you will find the education of little tree to be a refreshing , impeccably acted , original , wonderful , and touching film . \\ntake the whole family and bring a box of tissues for the tearjerkers . \\nthis one's as good as old yeller . \\n\", b' \" in dreams \" might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . \\nno , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie\\'s brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . \\nthe big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind \" the crying game . \" \\nhe\\'s no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . \\nthings start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji\\'s stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . \\nthis eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there\\'s even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn\\'t deserve so good a polish , it\\'s this one . \\ndon\\'t knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . \\nannette bening , another asset \" in dreams \" shouldn\\'t be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn\\'t do much for her in return . \\nshe plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children\\'s book illustrator who\\'s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . \\nshe thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . \\nthis being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it\\'s a credit to bening\\'s acting that she delves equally into claire\\'s madness and compassion . \\nbut as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , \" in dreams \" trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . \\nscenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . \\nsubplots appear and disappear . \\nwhen claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he\\'s clairvoyant and he\\'s got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates . \\n \" in dreams \" reaches its absurdist zenith here , and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . \\nsome questions , then : what\\'s with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? \\nare the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? \\nwho cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ? \\nwhat about the computer ? \\ndoes vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ? \\nwhy would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ? \\nis the woman in australia integral to anything ? \\nand the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ? \\nsigh . \\nat least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn\\'t go to waste . \\n', b'catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up . \\nshe has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy\\'s parents aren\\'t happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life . \\nas if trying to assure the boy\\'s parents wasn\\'t hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane\\'s mental faculties . \\na vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d\\'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls . \\njust after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia . \\nthe police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim\\'s body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state . \\nin a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher\\'s mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . . \\na cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours ! \\ninitial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . \\nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . \\nthe buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . \\'s \" losing my religion \" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . \\ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . \\nall of the sequences where we delve into someone\\'s mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . \\nthe first sequence that takes place in stargher\\'s mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i\\'ve ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher\\'s victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . \\nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . \\nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d\\'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . \\nin my opinion , d\\'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - \\nthe newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . \\nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . \\ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . \\nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher\\'s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . \\na sequence where catherine enters stargher\\'s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . \\none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device . \\nas a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking . \\nas a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done . \\nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together . \\nunfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) . \\n', b'plot : upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes , two roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself , since the school\\'s charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide . \\ncritique : despite this film\\'s interesting premise and dark subject matter , this movie sucks because it is unfunny , boring , and presents us with one of tom everett scott\\'s worst acting performances . \\nadd that to a completely unsuccessful romance element , many lame and corny jokes , a long wait for the setup , and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this \" black comedy \" ( if you\\'re gonna create a black comedy , don\\'t chicken out in the end-see very bad things ( 8/10 ) for a perfect example ) , and you\\'ve got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter . \\ni barely laughed at any gags , found the bong element contrived and repetitive , and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie ( if you\\'re gonna make a bad college comedy , at least slap in some free t&a shots for the kids : ) . \\nthis one\\'s not even worth the rental , fellas . \\nskip it altogether ! \\nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : during auditions for that thing you do ! , tom everett scott\\'s first feature film role , director tom hanks was opposed to hiring tom because of the fact that scott could\\'ve passed for hanks 15 years ago . \\nit wasn\\'t until hanks\\' wife rita wilson saw the audition tape , and decided he was cute , that hanks decided to risk hiring scott . \\nthe actor who played scott cooper in this film , mark-paul gosselaar , is best known for having played the character of zack morris on tv\\'s \" saved by the bell \" . \\nhis parents are dutch and named hans and paula . \\nand who would\\'ve guessed that this is director alan cohn\\'s first shot at directing a feature film ? \\n', b'the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film \" the world is not enough \" is its final frame : white letters on a black background proclaiming \" james bond will return . \" \\noh i certainly hope not . \\nwith pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go-round as james bond 007 , \" the world is not enough \" is the best example to date that \" \\'enough \" is enough . \\nin this , the 19th chapter in the seemingly-endless franchise featuring ian fleming\\'s debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis--and his nemeses--shaken not stirred , the sub-inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups , stunts , and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original . \\nwe\\'ve got previously-used speedboat chases , ski chases , and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines . \\nwe\\'ve got a couple of hot-to-trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them . \\nwe\\'ve got a post-cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction ( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean , lean panache ) . \\nand , as has been the case since 1977\\'s \" the spy who loved me , \" we\\'ve got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr . fleming . \\nwe\\'ve also got a main title song by garbage to which , with very little effort , you can fit the lyrics to * both * songs from \" tomorrow never dies . \" \\nwhile originality was never the series\\' strong suit , the films were almost always fun , with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts . \\ni can\\'t think of one memorable set-piece in the entire--and very dull-- \" the world is not enough . \" \\nin addition , michael apted ( yes , the respected director of such films as \" coal miner\\'s daughter , \" \" nell , \" and the \" 28up \" documentary series ) takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich ? s . \\nyou get the \" talking killer \" plot device--you know the scenario : the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age . \\nand you get a slew of high-priced assassins who can\\'t hit a barn door at 20 paces : in the film\\'s opening minutes ( of an endless 128 ) , bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leather-clad lovely fails to hit bond\\'s souped-up \" fishing boat \" with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her . \\nlater , she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out . \\nthese reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles , vodka , or credit cards . \\nin and among the rampant product placements , brosnan grapples with carlyle , \" braveheart \" \\'s sophie marceau ( as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king ; she\\'s terrible ) , \" wild things \" \\' denise richards ( as a nuclear physicist lord help me ; she\\'s laughable ) , and judi dench as m . dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its self-respect ( about the time roger moore inherited bond\\'s walther ppk ) . \\nbrosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm you\\'d expect of the former \" remington steele \" star , but even he has to be thinking there\\'s more to life than an easy paycheck . \\nhe\\'s given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver , but only one of them-- \" i don\\'t know any doctor jokes \" --made me chuckle ( although \" i thought christmas only comes once a year \" is more in keeping with the series\\' penchant for grown-worthy puns ) . \\n', b'what is a scary movie anyhow ? \\nis it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ? \\nis it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ? \\npossibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer . \\nwhat ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters . \\nmovies like \" halloween \" and \" psycho \" which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled \" the exorcist \" , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 \" the exorcist \" comes back to the big screen in a version you\\'ve never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending . \\nchris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan . \\nwhile working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden . \\nwhen chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter . \\nfather karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl . \\nchrist , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl . \\nexcrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death . \\nnow we get to the experience \" the exorcist \" the way it was meant to be seen in a director\\'s cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more . \\nthe movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing . \\nthe voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness . \\nas a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is \" the exorcist \" nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on . \\nellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in \" requiem for a dream \" to which she is getting rave reviews for . \\njason miller ( jason patrik\\'s dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along . \\ni was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff ! \\nanyway the re-release of the film has managed to make $40 million dollars , and is still going . \\nhopefully one day they re-release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy . \\n', b'at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . \\nthat\\'s true of home alone 2 and i\\'d bet money that it\\'s true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . \\nbut home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn\\'t get in the way . \\nthe mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . \\nfour adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . \\nthe littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids\\' cruelty . \\nkevin\\'s patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he\\'s going to have to starve . \\nhe attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . \\nthe fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . \\nthe knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . \\nnobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . \\nthe ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o\\'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . \\non his way up the stairs , he tells her that \" families suck \" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . \\nthat night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . \\nin a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . \\nit\\'s interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . \\nfirst they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . \\nthey\\'re two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . \\nmeanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . \\nhe\\'s finally rid of his family ! \\nlife is a dream come true . \\nhe can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother\\'s secret box . \\nslowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . \\nhe grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( \" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener \" ) . \\nhe also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . \\nthe furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . \\nmacaulay culkin is cute but he isn\\'t much of an actor . \\nstill , we can see that kevin\\'s character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . \\nfor example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as \" santa \" is getting in his car . \\nkevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . \\nhe learned how to deal with the furnace . \\nyou turn on the lights and it\\'s not so scary anymore . \\nhe goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . \\nthey talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . \\nfinally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . \\nthis last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie\\'s genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . \\nit\\'s a lot of fun , and it doesn\\'t overwhelm the rest of the movie . \\non the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . \\njohn williams\\' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . \\nbut it does have its flaws . \\nthe smallest problem is that culkin doesn\\'t act very well . \\nas i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin\\'s insight into his character . \\nthe biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin\\'s life about five times . \\ninstead of \" i\\'m gonna get that kid \" they say \" i\\'m gonna kill that kid . \" \\nsome might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . \\nmixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . \\ni\\'ll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . \\ndon\\'t let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . \\n', b'the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don\\'t count neil simon\\'s biloxi blues ) . \\nyear after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt . \\nbilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . \\ni thought stripes would be different . \\nwith ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . \\ninstead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army . \\nmurray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him . \\nso he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever . \\nthe characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette . \\nall the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular . \\nhe only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters . \\nhe was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud . \\nas with a lot of the late 70\\'s / early 80\\'s comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it . \\ni\\'m sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition \" dear god ! \" \\nevery few seconds . \\nstripes isn\\'t the playful kind of sex comedy , either . \\nmost of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women\\'s showers or murray lifts a female m . p . \\nonto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he\\'s going to give her the \" aunt jemima treatment , \" which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly . \\nyou don\\'t want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region . \\n \" i\\'m not enjoying this , \" the woman protests . \\nmy sentiments exactly . \\n', b'this is the movie that could single-handedly bring \" mystery science theater 3000 \" out of cancellation . \\nit\\'s one of those movies that\\'s so bad it\\'s absolutely hilarious , due in no small part to its big star , supermodel cindy crawford . \\nif you only remember one thing about fair game , it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues . \\nif you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l . a . , you\\'ll change your mind when you see fair game . \\nireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition . \\nin a real casting coup , crawford plays a super-intelligent lawyer ( in a jogging bra , of course ) . \\nwe all know this is a stretch , the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day . \\nnonetheless , someone out there thought she\\'d make a good lawyer , but we\\'re reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes . \\nand for you horny teenage boys out there , you

lawyer with a bunch of russians after her . \\nbilly baldwin ( or is it stephen ? \\nalec ? \\nadam ? \\nkim basinger ? ) is the police detective who has to save her life , time after time , chase after chase , explosion after explosion . \\nthere\\'s absolutely nothing original about this movie . \\nit\\'s every cop show of the 70\\'s mixed with every action thriller of the 80\\'s and every technology- exploitation movie of the 90\\'s . \\nthree decades of crap all in one place , driven further into the ground by crawford\\'s complete lack of acting talent . \\nand it\\'s all completely predictable . \\nyou know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them , you know when the \" sexual tension \" will finally end up in them consummating the relationship , you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movie\\'s going to suck from the first scene . \\nthe plot isn\\'t really explained until the end . \\nall we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer . \\nin the words of one of the villains , \" we even know what size pantyhose she wears . \" \\n ( yeah , you and every 14-year-old boy in america . ) \\nhe goes on to add , \" we know more about her than she does . \" \\n ( _that_ i find very easy to believe . ) \\ni hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes , because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones ( \" if it weren\\'t for me , you\\'d still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba ! \" ) \\nbecause , you see , fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting , but also some seriously bad dialogue . \\nit all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn\\'t supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh . \\none more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief . \\nwould you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like \" i\\'m very interested in _hard_ware \" and other crap about playing with his joystick ? \\ni wouldn\\'t , but not because i\\'m a computer nerd . \\nit\\'s just not funny . \\ncrawford\\'s only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords\\' body . . . \\nor was it jack lord\\'s body ? \\ni\\'ll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie . \\nthe boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft . \\ncrawford says woodenly , \" that was my client\\'s boat you just blew up . \\ni\\'m filing a lawsuit against you . \\nyou\\'re in big trouble , \" or something to that effect , and baldwin replies smugly , \" what do i have to do to get out of it ? \" \\nthey of course begin making out and the credits roll . \\ni\\'m not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how , if they\\'d really wanted to go for a bad closing line they would have had baldwin say , \" you think i could settle out of court ? \" \\nbut i will tell you that , if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her , you quote the final line of the movie to that person : \" what do i have to do to get out of it ? \" \\nserving america for over 1/50th of a century ! \\n', b'there was a huge crowd - so many over 100 people could not be admitted - at a

thinks he is a `darn\\' good loverboy , decides to leave his dusty ol\\' town somewhere in texas and go to new york . \\nhe puts on his beloved cowboy attire and off he hops on the next new york coach . \\nwhen he arrives to new york , he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he is the best `darn\\' `stud\\' in the whol\\'o\\' new york city . \\nobviously he fails . \\nhe meets the \\'cripple\\' rico ( dustin hoffman , who is terrifically good ) in a bar . \\nrico has a leg that is paralysed from the knee down , so he walks in a peculiar way . \\nrico is a thief and wants to get some money off this \\'rich\\' dumb cowboy . \\nhe cheats our cowboy out of $20 through a somewhat detailed routine and disappears . \\nsoon , our cowboy runs out of money : he gets kicked out of his hotel , and starts getting hungry . \\nwalking through the city , with \" everybody\\'s talkin\\' \" playing in the background ( oh , and his prided techno transistor radio in hand ) , he spots rico in a cafe . \\nrico , half-scared , pours out all the money in his pocket . \\n60 filthy cents . \\nour cowboy , hungry , is forgiving . \\nhe is glad he found someone he knows . \\nrico offers to

goddamn faggot ? \\nwhat do you want from me ? \\nwhere are my shoes ? \\nwhat did you do to them ? \" \\nbut all his doubts turn out to be unfounded . \\nrico really has a heart . \\ntogether , they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to death . \\nrico is convinced that the best place to be is florida , where the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees . \\nbut he falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida . \\n \" we will soon be in miami \" is the last sentence uttered in this film and what a shocking , moving end of a film it is . \\nthe classic theme music : \" midnight cowboy \" helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film . \\nwhether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams , is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable . \\n', b'the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it\\'s adequately explained by the commercials . \\nwith 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . \\ndeniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a \" pageant \" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . \\nand if there wasn\\'t anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . \\n ( a heist comedy ? \\nyup . \\ndeniro and hoffman are \" stealing \" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) \\nwag the dog succeeds because it\\'s based one great truth : the american people are stupid . \\nok , maybe it\\'s not \" love thy neighbor as thyself \" or even \" two plus two makes four \" , but a truth nonetheless . \\n ( any average person who thinks that they\\'re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) \\nand because we\\'re so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won\\'t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro\\'s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won\\'t be able to locate albania on the map . \\nthe beauty of wag the dog is that it isn\\'t a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . \\nnor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . \\ninstead , david mamet\\'s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . \\nit does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers\\' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . \\ndeniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . \\nit\\'s all : \" what do i love ? \\nwhat is it that brings me joy ? \\nbaseball , \" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . \\nhe threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he\\'s doing it in a very nice , polite way . \\nit\\'s a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . \\nhoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . \\nthis kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he\\'s so excited that he can\\'t even shut up . \\neven on the edge of disaster , he\\'s bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . \\ninsiders note that he\\'s basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . \\nthe best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . \\nthe characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don\\'t . \\nanne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . \\ndenis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the \" fad king \" , who handles the profitable \" back-end \" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . \\nthey could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i\\'d go see it . \\nwillie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious \" ballad of the green berets \" parody . \\nwoody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated \" hero \" of the albanian conflict . \\ncraig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . \\n ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) \\nwag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . \\nwe can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . \\nwag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don\\'t . \\n', b'i\\'m going to start this review off with a hypothetical question . \\nlet\\'s say you\\'ve just been in a car accident , and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious . \\nyour friends have left to go get help , and you\\'re waiting to see if the victim wakes up . \\na tow-truck comes along , and the driver hops out of the truck to see what\\'s going on . \\nhe then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck . \\ndo you : \\na ) run away screaming for your life , staying away from the main road , \\nb ) run away ( but not too fast ) and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you , * stop * to catch your breath , try to negotiate with the psycho , and when that fails , start running away again , all the while * staying on the main road * ? \\nif you answered \" a \" , you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of \" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation \" and will likely hate this movie . \\nhowever , if you answered \" b \" , prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind ! \\n \" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation \" is being called a sequel , but it\\'s really more of a remake of the original . \\nthere\\'s a few changes here and there , but it\\'s essentially the same ( even the infamous \" meathook \" scene has been re-created . ) \\nthe story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom , and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere . \\nneedless to say , they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family . \\nmuch carnage ensues . \\nto call this movie inept would be putting it mildly . \\nin addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question , there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere . \\nit just swoops down and kills him with its wheel . \\nno explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he/she is going around killing people with the planes wheel . \\nthe dialogue is even more atrocious . \\nzellwegger , who is kidnapped by \" the family \" early on , keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people . \\nwhen you\\'re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses , i would think that rationality would go out the window . \\nspeaking of going out the window , there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window . \\napparently , the stunt double had a little trouble , because she visibly gets stuck in the window . \\nthe director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double * doesn\\'t * get caught in the window . \\nthis was one of many glaring inconsistencies . \\nthere are so many , in fact , that if i were to name them all , this review would be several pages long . \\nthe only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey . \\nhe plays a member of \" the family \" with a hydraulic leg ( home-made , i might add ) and is so completely over-the-top , you can\\'t help but be amazed by his performance . \\nhe obviously had a lot of fun with this part , and it really shows . \\nhe makes jack nicholson\\'s portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in \" the shining \" look restrained in comparison . \\nfor a horror movie , \" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation \" contains surprisingly little gore . \\nin fact , in contains none . \\nthere\\'s a little blood here and there , but that\\'s as far as it goes . \\nwhich leads me to believe that the budget must have been * astonishingly * low , and it shows . \\neverything about the movie looks cheap , from the sets to the costumes . \\nespecially leatherface . \\nonce frightening and nightmare inducing , he\\'s now as terrifying as dame edna . \\ndo yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake . \\ncheck out the far superior original instead . \\n', b'plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention . \\nthe boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road . \\nwho\\'s on the up and up , who\\'s the real bad guy and who\\'s gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie . \\ncritique : the funnest movie that i\\'ve seen so far this year ! \\nit\\'s got style , it\\'s got tough guys talkin\\' shite and it\\'s got plenty of bullets to go around . \\na definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin\\' adventure ! \\na guy\\'s guy movie through and through , and one that\\'ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff . \\nit\\'s not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin\\' elvis lovers , who don\\'t stop till they , more or less , drop . \\nthis movie\\'s got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i\\'ve ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin\\' and the king\\'s music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments . \\nin fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim . \\nbut the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell\\'s been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness . \\ni guess he\\'s pissed at all the box-office bombs that he\\'s been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here . \\nin the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin\\' ass and making sure there\\'s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards . \\nand smoke \\'em if you got \\'em , folks ! \\nthere is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that\\'ll have you crackin\\' up and lovin\\' it all at the same time . \\nthe violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that\\'ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next . \\nit should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works . \\nthe film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse . \\ni was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well . \\nand did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ? \\nno . . . okay , \\nwell i just did ! \\ni coulda done without her whole \" romance \" angle , but to be honest , it doesn\\'t take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods . \\ntry to see how many \" inside \" connections to the king you can guess . \\nof course , it\\'s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind . \\ni also like these types of \" guy \" movies a lot , and even though the film doesn\\'t bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol\\' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell\\'s respective boots . \\nprobably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure . \\nnow see how many elvis songs i\\'ve used to pun my way through this phony review below . \\nthe elvis songs also recommend this movie ! \\nso whether you\\'re lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain\\'t one to return to the sender . \\ni really beg of you , whether you\\'re stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender . \\nand no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you\\'re the devil in disguise himself , i think you won\\'t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either . \\nso don\\'t be cruel , don\\'t turn away , don\\'t curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film . \\nit\\'s now or never , folks . \\ntrust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i\\'d seen so far this year is far behind me . \\njoblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building . \\nthank you . . . thank \\nyou very much ! ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nget carter ( 7/10 ) - heat ( 8/10 ) - honeymoon in vegas ( 9/10 ) - payback ( 8/10 ) - reindeer games ( 5/10 ) -reservoir dogs ( 9/10 ) - way of the gun ( 6/10 ) \\n', b'deep rising is one of \" those \" movies . \\nthe kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us . \\nit does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god . . . screw that , it says boldly , let\\'s see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors . \\nheh ! \\nthem wacky monsters , gotta love \\'em . \\nof course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra \" oumph \" to get people in theaters . \\nthat is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing . \\nconfused ? \\nlet me explain : \\ndespite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good \\'ol b movie . \\nluckily , it\\'s a very good b movie . \\nthe worst cliches in movie history are a b movie\\'s bread and butter . \\ntherefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre . \\nof course we know there\\'s a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive . \\nwe just don\\'t know when or how horrible it will be . \\ni went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high . \\nimagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times . \\na funny b movie ? \\nwell , that\\'s new . \\nthese flicks are not supposed to make us laugh . \\n ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while . ) \\nand before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen . \\nhey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies . \\ncool . \\nfamiliar faces . \\nso far so good . \\nour man treat is the hero , he\\'ll live . \\nwes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim . \\nwe know he\\'ll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out . \\nfamke is the babe , \\'nuff said . \\nthere is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy . \\n ( ah ! \\ncomic relief . \\nhow can we possibly explain having to kill him . . . let \\nhim live . ) \\nafter the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home . \\ni know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew . \\n ( please kill me . ) \\nsuffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went \" ewwww \" about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing . \\ni\\'m a man , we nottice these things . \\nall in all , i\\'d recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door . . . but \\nbring your sense of humor and excitement in with you . \\nthe acting is decent , the effects top rate . \\nhow to best describe it ? \\nput together the jet ski scene from hard rain , the bug attacks from starship troopers , a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming \" don\\'t go there , he\\'s behind you \" and you end up with deep rising . \\nfor creepy crawly goodness , tight t-shirts , major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water . \\n', b'with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft\\'s square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking . \\nno doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved . \\nbut why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? \\nobviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi . \\neverything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects . \\noverall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don\\'t sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling . \\nbut you won\\'t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , \" wow . . . \" \\nlike the series of games , final fantasy\\'s plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi . \\nit\\'s the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien \" phantoms . \" \\nwhenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors , the often-invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) . \\nwhile many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a \" zeus cannon , \" dr . aki ross ( ming-na ) and dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) plan to build a \" wave \" using eight collected \" spirits \" to counteract the phantoms and kill them off . \\nwhile the images serve the sci-fi aspect of the film well , the storytelling doesn\\'t . \\nit\\'s unfortunate , because the plot seems so intricately thought out . \\nperhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script . \\nsome could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english , except two americans wrote the screenplay . \\nnevertheless , the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes . \\nwhy do these aliens feed on souls ? \\nif they can pass through bodies and ships , how can humans hurt them with guns ? \\nwhat is so special about the \" spirits \" that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ? \\nworse yet , the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science-heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who\\'s doing the talking . \\nfor the most part , it\\'s bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don\\'t do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes . \\nthe only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming , who always has great cracks during tense moments . \\nbut , when the lights come up and the credits roll , you\\'re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked . \\nthere\\'s no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie , and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film . \\nyou\\'d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more . \\n', b'capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . \\njoe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . \\nit lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . \\nthe film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . \\ni had a good time . \\n , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \\nhere goes my credibility . \\nthis is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . \\ni liked the third jurassic park film . \\ni even liked the second jurassic park film . \\nin a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton\\'s novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle\\'s novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . \\njp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , \" for the boy who\\'s half man or the man who\\'s half boy . \" \\nthat is what all the jurassic park films are . \\nexpecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . \\nthe classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon\\'s mines had under-written characters also . \\njurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . \\nthe characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . \\nsome of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . \\nthat degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . \\ni feel i got my money\\'s worth . \\nthe story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . \\nthis was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . \\nthey hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island\\'s dinosaurs from a safe height . \\nthe height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . \\nthe two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . \\nflash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . \\nhe has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . \\nbut again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . \\ndoing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . \\nthey too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . \\nhe will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . \\nright . \\nguess what happens next ? \\njp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . \\nfirst it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . \\nsattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . \\ncuriously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . \\none thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . \\nthey did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . \\nof course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . \\nnot only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . \\nin this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . \\nthis time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . \\neach new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . \\nin this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . \\nit has a crocodile\\'s head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . \\nperhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . \\nsometimes they just move too fast to see . \\noccasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . \\na few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . \\nbut there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . \\nthe musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams\\'s score for the first film . \\njoe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . \\na team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . \\nthe film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . \\nif you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . \\ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n', b'since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they\\'re portraying , it\\'s fitting to say that \" beloved \" come as a real shock as a film . \\nit\\'s confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i\\'ve seen all year , and that\\'s not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . \\n \" beloved \" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , \" beloved \" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . \\n \" beloved \" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . \\nwhen the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . \\nsethe is proud , though , and will not move . \\nher sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . \\na couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . \\nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . \\nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies \" it ain\\'t evil . \\nit\\'s just sad . \" \\nsome more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . \\nbut when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . \\nher name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . \\nshe stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . \\nthey let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . \\n \" beloved \" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . \\nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . \\nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , \" they took my milk ! \" \\nworst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . \\nshe runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don\\'t leave them alone . \\nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn\\'t regret it . \\nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . \\nof course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren\\'t flat out told that until later on in the film . \\nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . \\nthus , \" beloved \" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , \" solaris , \" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . \\nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . \\n \" beloved \" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . \\nthe most interesting films are the ones that don\\'t explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . \\nsethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she\\'s being played by oprah winfrey . \\nit\\'s been well over a decade since her last major performance in \" the color purple , \" but judging from these two films , i\\'ll bet she\\'s one of the best actresses working today . . . if \\nshe was strictly an actress . \\nher talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that\\'s a shame because she brings so much to this movie . \\nemotion . \\nsadness . \\nstrength . \\nwatching the strong sethe , who\\'s so afraid of the past that she\\'s built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . \\nshe makes it real . \\nthat\\'s not to say this is a perfect film . \\nin fact , i\\'d wager to say that the fact that it\\'s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . \\nwhile oprah\\'s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i\\'m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn\\'t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . \\nit doesn\\'t necessarily move as though they\\'re memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \\nbut despite its tediousness , perhaps that\\'s the point . \\nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \\nand for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . \\njonathan demme\\'s direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . \\nthere\\'s more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . \\nthe acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . \\neveryone has been raving about thandie newton\\'s performance , and how it should be rewarded . \\nhowever , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . \\nact like a baby . \\nthrow things . \\nstumble around . \\nchew food with your mouth open . \\ni do think there\\'s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it\\'s kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother\\'s loss of reality towards the end . \\nit\\'s not that newton isn\\'t great : she\\'s as annoying and wacky as the role demands . \\nit\\'s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . \\ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , \" beloved \" has still not done well . \\ncosting , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . \\nunfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic \" caligula , \" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . \\nalthough i respect \" beloved , \" i can\\'t say that i really enjoyed it . \\n', b'there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason . \\n \" good will hunting \" is about one of those people . \\nthe will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let\\'s face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius . \\nhe can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino . \\nand he works at mit . . . as the janitor . \\none day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( \" breaking the waves \" \\'s stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete . \\nthe next day , it\\'s already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it . \\nso lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove . \\nand , duh , it\\'s done again . \\nof course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will . \\nbefore lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy . \\nafter going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , \" afternoon delight \" ) . \\nfinally , lambeau\\'s old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up . \\nturns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not . \\nit also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge . \\nand that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction . \\nis it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ? \\nshould this guy be forced to do something he doesn\\'t want to do ? \\nthis appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . \\ni\\'m not saying \" good will hunting \" is a bad film at all . \\nit\\'s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . \\nthe acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . \\nwe also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will\\'s love interest , skylar . \\nthere are tons of individual moments that i adored . \\ni loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . \\ni liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . \\nthere are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . \\nand there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . \\nlike the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean\\'s first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn\\'t regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . \\nhowever , the main flaw of the film is there\\'s too much of everything , and not enough of it either . \\nthe film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they\\'re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . \\ntake for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . \\nwe hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . \\nbut this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . \\nalso , will\\'s relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . \\nwe see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . \\ntheir relationship never goes beyond \" just best friends , \" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . \\nmaybe it was just me . \\nand it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . \\nand , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten . \\nwe never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it\\'s there for plot details that anything else . \\nminnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . \\nthe writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . \\nsure , it feels overstuffed , but it\\'s extremely enjoyable . \\nthe dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . \\ni think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . \\nwhile this is probably director gus van sant\\'s most conservative film ( you\\'d hardly know it\\'s the same director of \" to die for , \" the only van sant film i\\'ve seen , really ) , it\\'s still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what\\'s this \" best picture \" deal ? ) . \\nand if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone . \\n', b\"taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . \\nthe story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . \\neverything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . \\nalthough qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \\nliman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good . \\nthe film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good . \\nthere's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . \\nthe young cast are talented and help bring the story to life . \\nholmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature . \\naskew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . \\nno doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying . \\nhe drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it . \\nthe real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining . \\nalso entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance . \\nthe script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes . \\nit starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better . \\nthe stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another . \\nalso , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . \\nstill , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it . \\nit could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . \\nbecause this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent . \\nunlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus . \\ngo is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters . \\nthankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . ) \\nthey are who they are and they stay that way . \\ngo is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers . \\nignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \\nerm , go to go , i guess . \\n\", b'i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes . \\nthe original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor . \\nunfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed . \\nas the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie . \\nit\\'s a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film . \\nduring this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website . \\nthe movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously . \\nwe see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies . \\nwe see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him . \\nwe see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him . \\nno explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again . \\ni had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie . \\nthe movie cuts again , this time to the present . \\nthe young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors\\' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there\\'s no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the \" blair witch hunt , \" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website . \\nwe meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience . \\nsteven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria . \\ntristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence . \\nshe is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly . \\n ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out . \\nhow did i know ? \\nbecause in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) \\nthe fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . \\nthey pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . \\nkim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . \\npresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it\\'s never explained . \\nthe party of five heads off into the woods as promised . \\nthey reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr\\'s house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night\\'s events . \\nthere is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . \\nthe movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . \\nsexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . \\nthis would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . \\nthe next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen\\'s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . \\nthe videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , \" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! \" \\nooh . \\nspooky . \\nthe team goes back to jeffrey\\'s house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . \\nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . \\nwacky hijinks ensue . \\ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . \\nthroughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about \" reverse , \" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . \\nwhen they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . \\n ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . \\nokay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , \\nnevermind . ) \\nthis movie was awful . \\nsimply awful . \\nthe characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . \\nerica is the nature-loving wiccan . \\ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . \\nsteven is the overbearing asshole . \\nkim is the antisocial goth girl . \\nold , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . \\nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? \\nbecause she\\'s pregnant ! \\nhow do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? \\nbecause she wears a lot of eye makeup ! \\nhow do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? \\nbecause he has jagged teeth and talks like he\\'s straight out of \" deliverance \" ! \\nthis is weak storytelling at its worst . \\nrather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action . \\nit didn\\'t work . \\non top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid . \\n ( \" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie . \\nlet\\'s get on a plane home . \" \\n \" no . \\ni am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what\\'s going on . \" \\n \" ok . \" ) \\nfrankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch . \\ni also felt that there was simply too much blood \\'n\\' gore in this film . \\nthe first movie worked by never showing us the horror . \\nthe witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact . \\nthe horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be . \\nthis is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie . \\nblair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out . \\nthis was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey\\'s throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort . \\nknives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care . \\nthis movie didn\\'t stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything . \\nby the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours . \\nit is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail . \\ni confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying . \\ni have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no \" monster , \" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind . \\ni found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director\\'s intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all . \\n ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so . \\nand if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ? \\nthe snowfall of manuscript paper ? \\nhm ? ) \\nblair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie . \\nfrom the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots , it was a bad effort through and through . \\n', b\"_soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn't have jean claude van damme in it . \\ni could liken it to the sci-fi cheese that was the hollywood product-of-choice back in the early 80s , but that would be too much of a compliment . \\nif there is a movie theater in hell , this film is playing there 24 hours a day . \\nthe story , such that there is , revolves around todd ( kurt russell ) , an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not-too-distant ultra-conservative future ( is there any other kind ? ) \\nafter years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him , todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy . \\nwho the enemies in these wars are is never revealed , but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn't matter , because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys . \\nafter ten minutes of this nihilistic trash -- yes folks , there's more -- we see todd as a buff , scarred adult , now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat . \\nthere's a new wrinkle , though . \\ntodd and his brethren are declared obsolete , and a new batch of soldiers takes their place . \\nafter losing a sanctioned battle with _dragon_'s jason scott lee , the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice-cube tray ( well , that's what is looked like ) on a remote garbage planet . \\nif you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet , and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them , you're way ahead of the game . \\nthe renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half-expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute . \\nit's surprising that _soldier_ is the brain-child of _blade runner_ co-writer david webb peoples . \\nunlike that mind-twisting classic , this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double-spaced pages . \\nadd into the mix the _mortal kombat_'s paul anderson inept direction , and it's easy to see how _soldier_ turned out so bad . \\nand the special effects ! \\nremember the flying steam irons in hardware wars ? \\ngary busey is in this movie . \\n'nuff said . \\n_soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults . \\nthat this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all . \\nnow if you'll excuse me , i have to go weep for the future . \\n\", b'there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of \" scream queen \" in the early \\'80s . \\ntwo of them were halloween movies , but the other two -- prom night and terror train -- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween . \\nthe same \" god , i\\'m scared , there\\'s some guy in a mask coming after me \" routine she did in john carpenter\\'s classic , jamie lee copies here , with none of the urgency or suspense . \\nterror train takes place on ( where else ? ) a train , charted by some pre-med students finishing their first four years of higher education . \\nmost of them won\\'t make it to med school , though , and it\\'s obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains , \" i wish to hell they\\'d put a radio on that train . \" \\nthe conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone , even jamie lee . \\nfrom the beginning , he\\'s talking his head off ( he tells one of his co-workers \" think on this -- when\\'s the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station ? \" \\nas if it makes any kind of sense ) and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles . \\nof course , the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body , which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it . \\ni forgot to mention the prologue . \\nit\\'s a party three years earlier , with the same group of students . \\ntwo of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge , promising him he\\'s going to get laid . \\nthey send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in , noticing a form on the bed . \\nshe says , \" kiss me , kenny , \" and he kisses the body on the bed , which happens to be a cadaver . \\n ( \" oh my god , they killed kenny ! \\nyou bastards ! \" ) \\nit\\'s a sick trick , and one jamie lee wasn\\'t let in on . \\nshe still hasn\\'t forgiven the guy as they board the terror train ( \" you asshole , you can\\'t have a good time without hurting somebody ! \" ) . \\nthe killing starts before the train even leaves the station . \\nsince it\\'s new year\\'s , everyone\\'s wearing disguises ( a convenient plot device we\\'ve seen before ) , and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one\\'s looking . \\nat least one of the characters says it\\'s a groucho mask ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard , it looks like gene shalit who , by the way , would make a great killer in a slasher movie . \\nspeaking of weird-looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene , one of terror train\\'s most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield \" as the magician , \" who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music . \\nthen there\\'s his greatest trick -- getting laid with hair that looks like that . \\nfor all its attempts at visual style and substance , terror train is more lionel than amtrak , more prom night than halloween , and nothing really worth watching . \\nonly die-hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield ( if he truly has any fans ) should even attempt to watch it . \\nand it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse . \\ni mean , when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station , anyway ? \\nterror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car . \\n', b\"near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . \\nthe following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . \\nat best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . \\nin 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . \\nthere have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . \\ndreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . \\nthe other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . \\nalthough camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . \\nunfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . \\nin making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . \\nthe animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . \\nthe animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . \\nthe key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . \\nnamely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . \\ndreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . \\nthe story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . \\nfor the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . \\nthe writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . \\nin fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . \\nmoses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . \\nmoses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . \\nby this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . \\nthe cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . \\nthe script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . \\nit's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . \\nbut for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch . \\n\", b'there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . \\nwhen i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . \\nyou see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . \\ni hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . \\ni hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac\\'s shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . \\nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying . \\nit\\'s confounding . \\ni can\\'t believe a film can be this bad . \\nand yet , it\\'s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . \\nin the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . \\nin the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn\\'t want to kill himself . \\nwhile there , he notices that the doctors don\\'t care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . \\nso , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . \\nhe goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it\\'s good to help people . \\nhe also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . \\nnaturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . \\nso patch decides that he\\'s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . \\nand that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . \\non a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn\\'t say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter\\'s performance , even if she is wasted ) . \\nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution . \\nevery scene swells with grand , \" emotional \" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . \\ntake , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . \\nwe don\\'t know patch yet , but there\\'s sad music , and it\\'s supposed to make us really sad that he\\'s sad . \\nlater on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . \\nand when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . \\nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . \\nreal drama is character-based . \\nyou grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . \\nwe don\\'t ever grow to know the dying patient ; he\\'s simply a vehicle for patch\\'s greatness . \\nreal drama doesn\\'t seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . \\nthat\\'s why patch adams is not real drama . \\nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . \\neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman\\'s sickening musical score . \\nsentimentality like this is indeed bad . \\nbut it\\'s not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . \\nyou see , patch is a really great student . \\nhe aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he\\'s cheating . \\nbut patch doesn\\'t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . \\n \" why don\\'t we see patients until the third year ? \" he bursts out every three seconds . \\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \\nmost of us have to study . \\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\\'t be too successful in preventing death . \\noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" \\nyes ! \\nthat is true ! \\nand you can not do that without studying . \\nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \\nfollow the rules ? \\nbah ! \\nwho needs the rules ! \\nonly uptight doctors follow the rules . \\nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . \\nand then there\\'s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . \\na free clinic . \\nin the middle of the forest . \\nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . \\nfor free . \\nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ? \\nwill it have an emergency room ? \\nor is it just for mental patients ? \\nand who , may i ask , will pay for it ? \\nthe film does give some token attempts to question patch\\'s motives ( i think another character asks him how he\\'s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don\\'t explore or challenge patch\\'s ideas to any meaningful extent . \\nreader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . \\ni know nothing about him . \\nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . \\nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . \\nand in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . \\nactually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . \\nhe shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . \\ni won\\'t tell you that you can\\'t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . \\ni was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . \\npatch adams is the cheapest of them all . \\n', b\"phil ( radmar jao ) has a hairy problem . \\nhis beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour . \\nhe recently met the author of a non-fiction book on lycanthropy , also referred to in the movie as werewolfism , and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf . \\nusing enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention , he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him . \\nand phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs . \\nmade on a pittance , the film features an almost exclusively asian-american cast . \\nas directed by quentin lee and justin lin , the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films . \\njeanne chin plays katherine , a meek and soft-spoken wife , who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex . \\nwe know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins , real and imagined , to her therapist . \\nas her husband , jim , clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness . \\nthe picture is filled with stereotypes . \\nthere's a mysterious , loud-mouthed waitress with a big , platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that she's a lesbian . \\nshe spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer , a gay guy . \\nand the lone white with a major role , the author on werewolfism , has wildly unkempt , orangey blonde , curly hair . \\nfrom its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist , the script rarely has anything to offer . \\nthe story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad-libbing . \\none can only hope that the directors' next film will have some substance and some credible acting . \\nshopping for fangs runs 1 : 30 . \\nit is rated r for sex , violence , and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers . \\n\", b'if the 70\\'s nostalgia didn\\'t make you feel old , the 80\\'s nostalgia is bound to . \\none of the latter set ,

. \\n . \\nand the music . \\n . \\n . \\nand references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times , but it all seems tediously-and too obviously-inserted for the didn\\'t-we-dress-funny-back-then chuckle . \\nthe plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original : robbie ( adam sandler ) is a wedding singer ; julia ( drew barrymore ) waits tables at weddings . \\nboth are engaged ; however , robbie\\'s fiance ( angela featherstone ) dumps him at the altar , and julia\\'s fiance ( matthew glave ) is a skirt-chasing speculator in junk bonds . \\nrobbie and julia go through the

don\\'t get include pauly shore and pee wee herman-make your own judgments ) . \\nthe stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself . \\nidol looks like hell , and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup . \\nhe\\'s mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene . \\nwe\\'re not supposed to notice that , and we\\'re not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie . \\nother cameos , by steve buscemi and jon lovitz , provide the only real laughs in the movie . \\nlovitz is especially good , playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbie\\'s post-break-up depression . \\n', b'it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm . \\nhe had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes . \\nfor those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public . \\nto achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series\\' theme , which is missing in the movie ) \" bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space \" , and is monitoring nelson\\'s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure . \\nrather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot . \\nthe format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned . \\nonly two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester\\'s sidekick , tv\\'s frank , and the slower pace of the jokes . \\nthis latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke . \\nfor their big screen outing , the producers have chosen \" this island earth \" , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill . \\nunfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today\\'s standards , are less than impressive . \\nnelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan\\'s dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle\\'s kingdome , and most of them work . \\nunfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite\\'s movie theater seem out of place and aren\\'t particularly funny , but at least they\\'re fairly short . \\nthe big question about this movie though is : why ? \\ni presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound . \\nso , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts . \\nnevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you\\'re going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse . \\ngiven its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of \" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies \" it does well . \\n', b'with stars like sigourney weaver ( \" alien \" trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . \\nsadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller . \\nhelen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak . \\nincidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . \\na year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . \\ndetective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first . \\ncopycat \" borrows \" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work . \\nbut copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . \\nmuch of the time wasted could\\'ve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . \\neven so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . \\nweaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . \\nharry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . \\nwhich comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) . \\ncopycat is a good thriller . \\nalthough the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . \\nthis worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . \\nnice movie to

wish you had heard them . \\noh how i wish someone had stopped him . . . \\nbecause he\\'s done it again . \\nthe plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale . \\nin fact , it was everything that 8mm is not . \\nin the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government . \\nkeep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves . \\nhe returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it\\'s important as well ) . \\nhe\\'s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery . \\nafter her husband\\'s death she comes across a film in his private safe . \\nit appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera . \\nthe woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film . \\nso he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film . \\nthe main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless . \\nwelles is actually selected for the case by the old woman\\'s lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) . \\nwhen you first see him , your first instinct is that he\\'s behind the whole thing . \\nthe choice of casting does the film in . \\nthen , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him . \\nthe only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet . \\nso your first instinct has now been confirmed . \\nthen , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous \" since we\\'re going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing \" moments ) . \\nbut earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he\\'s told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended . \\nhuh ? \\nalso , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back . \\nso why did he give it up in the first place ? ! \\nthe lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! \\nit\\'s totally absurd . . . \\nand this is the screenwriter of seven ? \\nlate in the film there\\'s a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character\\'s guns ends up underneath a car . \\ncage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table . \\njames gandolfini\\'s character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of \" suspense \" . \\nyou see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he\\'s trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching . \\ngo around to the other side of the car ! ! \\nthis goes on for minutes . \\nthen , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car . \\nboy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves . \\ni think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he\\'s seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! \\nwe actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard . \\nother things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that . \\nwhenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it . \\nawful decision there joel . \\nanother is cage\\'s performance . \\nat this point he\\'s capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad . \\nfor 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he\\'s interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) . \\nyou\\'re capable of much better mr . cage . \\nnow as for you mr . schumacher . . . \\ni\\'m starting to doubt if you\\'re capable of anything else besides

\\nthe warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body . \\njungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it\\'s difficult to integrate both . \\noften we\\'ll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung\\'s magician , sit around imagining grand schemes . \\nwithout the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams . \\nwarriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy . \\nthey don\\'t care enough about anything to know what\\'s worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle . \\nthis dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies . \\namerica during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers . \\ntodd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype . \\nchosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine . \\nhis childhood is cruelty and competition . \\nhe is indoctrinated with the big rules . \\nnever question authority . \\nwinning is everything . \\nstrength beats knowledge . \\na veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he\\'s obsolete . \\na new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger . \\nleft for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he\\'s unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world . \\nobviously our hero is still alive . \\nhe finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health . \\nwhen the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world . \\nthey are the other good guys . \\nthese lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons . \\ntodd finds himself in the role of protector . \\nwhat could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon . \\nthe effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion . \\nthe plot is old hat . \\nwe don\\'t get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers . \\nhardly anything makes sense . \\nthe film\\'s science fares badly . \\nwith all the remarkable advances we\\'ve made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we\\'re still stupid . \\nafter conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away . \\neven stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines . \\nvirtually all the trash is vintage 1960 . \\nthere is nothing in the story that is not predictable . \\nthe first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him . \\nit doesn\\'t take a genius to foresee that her husband isn\\'t going to be around much longer . \\nis it a shock to find out that the film\\'s climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ? \\nwho would you guess wins ? \\nsome of the scenes would work if this were a comedy . \\ntodd\\'s first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie\\'s nipple poking through her thin blouse . \\nlater as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion . \\nsupposedly this clich ? isn\\'t meant to be humorous . \\ndastardly col . mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash . \\nresponsible for

todd . \\nthe acting isn\\'t anything to write home about . \\nnielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim . \\nrussell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it\\'s not much of a challenge . \\nuttering around 100 words during the film , mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space . \\ngary busey as todd\\'s commanding officer

the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine . \\nas `sleepy hollow' opens , we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton's `ed wood' . \\nlandau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider . \\nafter two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate . \\nlandlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods . \\ncrane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) . \\nfirst and foremost , `sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film . \\nas with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly . \\nthe horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors . \\nbut why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow' as much as i did ? \\nalthough enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . . \\nit was the light comic touch that burton applied . \\nthe film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities . \\nthis is certainly not the only alteration that's been made . \\nas the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves . \\nthe momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved . \\nit's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive . \\nstill , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton's keen eye to capture our attention . \\nthe costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it's recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) . \\nthe supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many . \\na blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel's daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent . \\nwalken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton's `batman' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles . \\ni suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy . \\nall of this is not to be taken seriously , of course . \\n`sleepy hollow' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children . \\nif you've got a decent head on your shoulders , you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time . \\n\", b\"in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . \\nthe groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen't see a shadow , it will be an early spring . \\nphil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . \\nhowever , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him . \\ngroundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . \\nthe screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy . \\nalthough the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . \\nramis's direction also helps , and although he dosen't try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well . \\nand the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . \\nthe performances are also excellent . \\nbill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . \\nandie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . \\nthere is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . \\nchris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . \\nthe supporting cast aren't bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . \\nin fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . \\noverall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . \\nit almost seems perfect . \\nhowever , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over . \\nalso , there's not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad . \\nbut these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . \\noverall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . \\nan excellent comedy . \\noverall rating= ( \\n\", b'capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing . \\nnot exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time . \\nextended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum . \\nalas , the times are a-changin\\' . \\nin a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts . \\nthis brings us to hong kong director kirk wong\\'s first american feature , the big hit . \\noddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released . \\nadvertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it . \\nthe big hit is quite the opposite . \\nit was hyped as \" the new film from producer john woo \" , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action . \\nhowever , there\\'s a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit . \\nthe film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver . \\nmel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps . \\nsadly , he doesn\\'t get a chance to do much of it . \\nexcept for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode . \\nthe action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff . \\nwong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut . \\nhowever , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough . \\nthey start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop . \\nnormally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable . \\nluckily , we have ben ramsey\\'s screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work . \\nthe only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few . \\nsome of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel\\'s hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism . \\nthe only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes doesn\\'t . \\noverall , the big hit may have it\\'s flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride . \\ndefinately one of the better ways to spend two hours . \\n', b\"to watch `battlefield earth' is to wallow in misery . \\nit is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history . \\nit has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible . \\nworse , there's the promise of a sequel . \\nwhy ? ! \\nsave your money . \\nsome films go quickly to video . \\nthis one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel's `mystery science theatre . ' \\nin the year 3000 , man has become an endangered species . \\nmost of humanity ( called ? man-animals' ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos ) . \\nsurvivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth's resources for the rest of their lives . \\nthe aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall , who resemble inbred klingons . \\ndimwitted as they are tall , their culture is predicated on power , extortion , and getting ? leverage . ' \\ntravolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth . \\nmuch of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl's petty machinations . \\nhe routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter . \\nbut one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth . \\nwhen the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan . \\nhe will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site . \\nit's not clear how this benefits terl , except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it . \\nthe scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave group's leader . \\na psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how . \\nbut the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language , the principles of our founding fathers , euclidean geometry , and the location of fort knox . \\nthis enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining assignment . \\nit also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors . \\n`we're going to blow up their home world , ' he says . \\n`but first , we need a few more supplies . ' \\nin days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts . \\nby now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl . \\nthe media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta's labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel . \\nnumerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning . \\nand after watching this movie , you'll wholeheartedly agree . \\nthis is a terrible film that is illogically constructed , tediously acted , and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ? \\nat a price tag of $90 million , this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly , assuredly becoming `the avengers' of this summer . \\nboth films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity . \\nin addition to the universally pejorative reviews , there's another bizarre element to the `battlefield' saga . \\nthis film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta , who for over a decade , had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen . \\nthe controversy is that travolta is a scientologist , and `battlefield' is based on a 1982 novel by l . ron hubbard , the religion's late founder . \\nthis led some to believe that `battlefield earth' would amount to scientologist dogma , laden with subliminal messages . \\nbut the story is so poorly told that any message , subliminal or otherwise , is totally undetectable . \\nif the audience got anything out of this film , it was this : we are not too unlike the psychlo leader . \\nlike terl , the audience felt imprisoned , dreaded their situation , and looked for any opportunity to leave . \\ncould that be the scientology message ? \\n\", b'look ! the new version of \" psycho \" came out and the world didn\\'t end ! \\ni guess gus van sant really isn\\'t the bringer of the apocalypse ! \\nunfortunately , though , that \" psycho \" didn\\'t end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it . \\nvan sant\\'s controversial \" re-telling \" of alfred hitchcock\\'s classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere ( even before it premiered . ) \\nwithout benefit of an actual viewing , many have said that the film will , at best , suck . \\nbeing an ( almost ) good critic , i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film , at best , sucked ( and that concludes the use of the word \" suck \" and , hopefully , the thoughts that i am a brain-dead orangutan . ) \\ndirector gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it , shot-for-shot , using the same , exact script ( with a few minor alterations . ) \\nthe inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary , even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time . \\nsuspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original . \\nsadly , that did not occur . \\nit is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin ( from the original \" psycho ) , but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen . \\nin moore\\'s case , the film would have been helped if \" the x- files \" gillian anderson had been cast instead ; especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression ! \\nfrom the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence , moore is scully ! \\nmortensen ( who i liked in \" g . i . \\njane \" ) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy/hick , which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point . \\nsam has a twang and a cowboy hat , but that\\'s about it . \\nmortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory . \\nanne heche , in the janet leigh role , does a few good things in her brief time on screen . \\nat least her marion crane has a little life in her , which can\\'t be said for most of the rest of the cast . \\nthe best work , though , comes from vince vaughn , as the demented mama\\'s boy , norman bates . \\nhe\\'s not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins , but he is effective both in being naughty and nice . \\nthe best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn , where they simply talk . \\nthere is some solid acting there , something that is not carried through the rest of the film . \\nvan sant has made a boring film . \\nall the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren\\'t as eye-catching now . \\nwhat passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don\\'t impress or excite . \\nvan sant , in what i assume is a grasp at originality , decided to put some stream-of-consciousness images into a few famous scenes ( was that a lamb in the middle of the road ? ) \\nthese images , included with some questionable editing choices , took away from the scenes themselves and caused , at first , bewilderment and , later , laughter . \\ndefinitely not hitchcock\\'s intention ! \\nat least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann\\'s original famous and terrific score . \\nif a film like \" psycho \" does not frighten , then what\\'s the point . \\naside from norman , the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience . \\nthere are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting . \\nin the end , however , the new \" psycho \" is a noble attempt , but , alas , a dismal failure . \\n', b'not too many people know who james whale is , but it\\'s a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies . \\nif we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way . \\nthis is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie . \\ngods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale\\'s life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it\\'s probably a better movie for it . \\nit\\'s focus is on whale\\'s ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) . \\nit begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to \" sit for him , \" ( pose for a portrait ) . \\nat first , boone doesn\\'t realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man . \\nwhen he does discover whale\\'s sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy . \\nbut he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale\\'s \" locker room talk . \" \\nboone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned \" locker room talk , \" and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening . \\nmeanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago . \\nhis ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor . \\nwhat is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser\\'s bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) . \\ni was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here . \\nthis is impressive because his character\\'s dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking . \\nthat requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well . \\nthis is not to ignore mckellan\\'s oscar nominated turn . \\nhe earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem . \\nwhale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield . \\nhe rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people . \\nin the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n', b'we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist . \\nyears later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80\\'s a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world . \\nthe movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown . \\nbased on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father . \\nin the 1950\\'s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy . \\nthe film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys . \\ndavid is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia . \\nthe effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher\\'s house . \\nhe is well lit via the external house lights . \\nhis teacher isn\\'t home . \\nwe pull back and see that the dark front room\\'s window has it\\'s curtains open . \\nthere , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano . \\ndavid\\'s fall over the dark cliff has begun . \\ninstead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala \" pulp fiction \" . \\nthis narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets . \\nthe film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion . \\nadult-helfgott\\'s return to the light is told in linear fashion . \\nthe lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out . \\nwhilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work . \\nhis david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his \" daddy \" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny . \\ntaylor\\'s teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role . \\nwe are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building . \\nhis father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov\\'s 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart . \\ntechnically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production . \\ni particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects . \\none scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain . \\nthe sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice . \\nwith a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat . \\nthe image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd . \\nbut it\\'s us being clapped . \\nwe are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show . \\nthe music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical . \\nand it works very well . \\nthe \\'miming\\' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn\\'t mime ; he really did play ) \\nhelfgott\\'s life is certainly not without it\\'s sympathetic people . \\nindeed his return to the \\'normal\\' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women . \\nhis ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft . \\nit shows that with the \\'help of god\\' we can all find our way back home . \\n', b'take two old and dying men , a lifetime of regrets , a house full of sins , a thoroughly despicable man , enough lies , insecurities and other character defects to keep a team of psychiatrists

movie tells multiple stories , weaving them together , or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time . \\nwould that the stories were worth the telling . \\nearl partridge ( jason robards , a thousand acres ) is dying of cancer . \\nbedridden , in much pain , it is obvious that his time is growing short . \\nhis much younger wife played by julianne moore ( an ideal husband ) is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death . \\nhaving married for money , she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied . \\nearl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son ( tom cruise , eyes wide shut ) , now a misogynist self-help guru who teaches men how to \" seduce and destroy , \" his sexual and vulgar perspective on male/female relationships is so over-the-top as to be utterly unbelievable . \\nmeanwhile , jimmy gator ( philip baker hall , the insider ) is also dying of cancer . \\nnot as physically incapacitated as earl , jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a long-running quiz show which pits adults against children . \\nthe current whiz-quiz-kid is stanley spector ( jeremy blackman in his film debut ) who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits . \\non the other hand , quiz kid donnie smith ( william macy , mystery men ) would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was a \" somebody . \" \\nhis pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish . \\njimmy has his own family crisis as his drug-addict daughter ( melora walters , boogie nights ) refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film . \\ngrabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop ( john c . reilly , never been kissed ) even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection . \\nthis dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two-thirds of the movie . \\nand then it gets worse , literally raining frogs . \\nyes , frogs . \\nassuming it to be an intended deus-ex-machina device , it is an ineffective one because it doesn\\'t seem to faze the characters much . \\noh , they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets , but otherwise , the frog shower didn\\'t seem to change their behavior or pattern of living ( or dying ) . \\nthere is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch . \\nmr . anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue , a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble , and a heavy handed segment of \" historical \" occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing . \\none of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes : \" we may be done with the past , but the past is not done with us . \" \\nthis is an absolute lie . \\ngod is in the forgiveness business . \\nin fact , as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset , god\\'s word says that he not only forgives , he also forgets . \\n \" i , even i , am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake , and will not remember thy sins . \" \\nisaiah 43 : 25 [kjv] \\nthe spiritual one who keeps bringing up our unrighteous past is the same one who wants to keep us in a state of condemnation . \\ndon\\'t let him . \\nnext time your spiritual adversary reminds you of your past , take great pleasure in reminding him of his future . \\nhe hates that . \\n', b'for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what\\'s left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things . \\nas a rule , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor . \\nan actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck . \\ngenerally , though , the actor doesn\\'t matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers , exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz . \\nthe star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less . \\nrussell plays todd , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought . \\nthe movie lets us see this degenerate process , but by the time the real plot starts , we\\'re into todd\\'s later years . \\nhe\\'s about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers , ones who , instead of being trained * from * birth , are genetically selected * before * birth . \\nthe pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he\\'s the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie\\'s start . \\nbetween the two leads , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken , and it\\'s possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction . \\ndirector paul anderson , who helmed last year\\'s icy thriller , event horizon , doesn\\'t show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam . \\ntodd , upon being replaced , is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out , the villains return to the garbage planet on a \" routine patrol \" and set the stage for the final firefight . \\nevents are predictable from the time that the setups are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here . \\nthe most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact , not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry . \\nit\\'s not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it . \\nthe best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare , like universal soldier . \\na strict interpretation , however , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style , class , or substance ; and by next year , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television . \\n', b'after having heard so many critics describe \" return to me \" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \\nwhat made \" return to me \" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \\nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \\nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \\nthe charisma of the two leads ? \\neven now i can\\'t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven\\'t see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \\ni don\\'t think any of the romances i\\'ve seen have been classified as such . \\nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- \" return to me \" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \\nit was traditional , magical . \\nwe knew it couldn\\'t be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \\nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn\\'t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \\nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt\\'s direction . \\nfrom the very first bird\\'s eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the \" return to me \" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we\\'re in for something sweet . \\nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \\nreal people don\\'t act that way ; real people aren\\'t that nice . \\nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks\\' existence . \\nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt\\'s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \\neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \\n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob\\'s wardrobes . \\nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \\nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \\n \" return to me \" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \\nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we\\'re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \\nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \\ndisappointingly , david alan grier\\'s charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \\nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \\ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of \" the x-files . \" \\nduchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . \\nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . \\nthough an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . \\nwhile \" return to me \" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . \\nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife\\'s heart . \\nwe already know that there\\'s going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . \\nas a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she\\'s supposed to have his ex-wife\\'s heart and everything--it seems too effortless . \\nthe main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . \\nhowever , in the spirit of \" return to me , \" it won\\'t do to be too picky about how \" old \" hollywood tells its stories . \\ni loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . \\nit shows . \\nthe bottom line : \" return to me \" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn\\'t imagined . \\n', b'plot : a big-time momma\\'s boy can\\'t seem to leave his mother\\'s crib and make good on the babies that he himself has produced in the world . \\nhe visits his kids ( and their mommas ) every now and then , but his main goal in life is . . . well , he doesn\\'t have any goals . \\nthen one day , his mother gets an ex-gangsta boyfriend and suddenly he isn\\'t as welcome anymore in his own house . \\nit isn\\'t long after that , that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well . . . it\\'s \\neither time to grow up or bow down ! \\ncritique : first things first ! \\nthis movie ain\\'t about the \" hood \" at all , it\\'s an intelligent film about love , relationships , family , friendship , maturity and growing up . \\ndo not avoid this film because you think it\\'s about gangbangers and stuff , because it isn\\'t at all . \\nit\\'s about you , it\\'s about me , it\\'s about your girlfriend , your mother , your problems and your inability to face up to your responsibilities and to , well . . . grow \\nup ! \\nthis is an extremely well-written film , with some of the most developed characters that i\\'ve seen on the screen all year , with superb acting performances to match . \\ngranted , the film does start a little slow ( and go a little long ) , but hang in there , because once you appreciate and get to know all of its characters , you will be glad that you did . \\nthis isn\\'t a kid\\'s movie . \\nthis is about the step that you need to take in order to pass into full \" adulthood \" and some might not appreciate the grander theme behind that step . \\ni certainly did , because i too passed , and am passing , through many of these very same things right now ( yeah , yeah , i still live with my momma ! ! ) and related to a lot of the events that went down in this flick ( oh yeah , and for the record , i\\'m not black but that made absolutely zero difference in this case ) . \\nbut that\\'s not even half the story . \\nyou see , the film is damn funny , too . . . and \\ni mean , damn funny ! \\ni was crackin\\' up at almost every other scene , and they weren\\'t \" set-up jokes \" like your typical comedies either , just day-to-day things that we could all relate to ( like the scene in which ving rhames is \" drinking koolaid \" in the kitchen and his infamously improvised \" african squat f * * k \" scene , which you just gotta see to believe ! ) \\nand there are the performances , too . \\nving rhames , now here\\'s a man who has already established an early lead in the race for best supporting actor at the end of this year . \\ndamn dude , you scared the shit outta me ! \\ntyrese gibson , i have no idea where this guy came from ( an r&b singer and mtv vj , you say . . . hmmmm ? ) , but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs , he nailed this part to the tee . \\nfrom scene one on , i was glued to his performance and sympathized with his character as he molded and shaped himself into the person that he hoped to become one day . \\nand everyone else , too . \\ngibson\\'s girlfriend in the film , taraji henson , made me a backer with her many subtle touches , all of which helped raise her character several levels above the \" typical \" bitchie girlfriend that we\\'ve seen in many of these relationship movies . \\nbut that\\'s the thing that i liked the most about this movie . \\neveryone seemed real , the situations felt authentic , the characters all came across as people like you and me with issues and struggles and hopes and fears . \\ni liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written , wonderfully acted and genuinely entertaining to watch . \\nand yeah , i even liked the whole homage to boyz \\'n the hood that singleton pulled off in the end ( he called this movie a \" companion piece \" to that film ) . \\na very solid follow-up to an ever greater original , baby boy is a film to be seen by anyone who feels like they never wanna grow up . \\nnote : the guy who plays jody\\'s best friend in this movie is omar gooding , cuba gooding jr . \\'s younger brother (

\\n', b'capsule : combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark , a dash of a jackie chan movie ( sans jackie ) , two teaspoons of gun- and swordplay , and a dollop of cgi . \\nsimmer for 100 minutes . \\nyields : zilch . \\nthe phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier , better movies that after the fifteen-minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud . \\nit\\'s hard to make a good action-adventure movie that doesn\\'t simply recycle its predecessors , and i\\'ve seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully . \\nthe phantom , allegedly based on the long-running comic of the same name , doesn\\'t even bother to be graceful . \\nit\\'s a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list , but i\\'ll try . \\nthe film opens up with a \" prelude \" sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voice-over to compensate for whatever got thrown out . \\nwe go from there to a jungle sequence that , i swear to god , recycles the truck-chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note-for-note , possibly even shot-for-shot , right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush -- and then goes on to rip off the rope-bridge scene from \" sorcerer \" as well ! \\nsorcerer , as you may well remember , was a remake of a french movie , the wages of fear , in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain . \\nboth versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick , but i\\'ve got my job to do , so back to the salt mines we go . \\nanyway , the cinematic theft doesn\\'t stop there . \\nor at least the lack of inspiration . \\nthere isn\\'t a single thing here we haven\\'t seen , and it\\'s not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest . \\nwe have ( where\\'s my list ? ) \\na bad girl , a tough good girl , a secret cave hideaway ( which seems inspired more by dr . \\nno than anything else ) , a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality , magical artifacts of terrible power , and cary-hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself . \\nwhat else is there ? \\nthe plot is a waste of time . \\nthe sets alternate between big but hokey -- and tiny and still hokey . \\nthere are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked -- and i\\'m sure once mike and the \\'bots get the cash , they\\'ll stick it on their sked . \\nthe only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane -- he\\'s a good actor , and he tries very hard , even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another . \\nall i can say is that i pray this isn\\'t the beginning of the end for him -- although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic-book super-hero movie . \\n', b'the makers of jurassic park & the director of speed conjure up a storm ! \\n ( reviewed at eng wah\\'s new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio ) \\n \" unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise . \\nunlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited . \\nunlike fires , there is no way to combat them . \\nunlike floods , their terror is sudden . \" \\n- excerpt from twister production notes \\ni\\'m sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before . \\ni for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes . . . . . . . . that is until i saw twister . \\nthe destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable . \\nit will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc . . . . . \\nbasically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you\\'ll get to see all this - close up ! \\ntwister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers . \\nthese people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can . . . . . that \\nis if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them ! \\njo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes . \\nwhile they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo . \\napparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman . \\nhe catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone . \\njo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement\\'s of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented . \\nthe problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function . \\nto add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device . \\nthus begins the race ; jo\\'s cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas\\'s high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans . \\nplot wise , there are not really anything to shout about . \\ntwister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get . \\nthere is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance ) . \\nhelen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself ! \\nthanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm\\'s industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock ! \\njan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences . \\nlike his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited . \\naudiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen ! \\nthe surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister ! \\n ( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect-dependent movie . \\nnow that id4 fever has begun to reside , and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et\\'s ass for the umpteenth time . . . . . . twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent ! \\nwatch it in a good theatre . . . please . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n', b'by-the-numbers : a film which introduces characters , situations , dilemmas and developments that we\\'ve seen before in a parade of other films . \\na film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one . \\na film which is packed to the cap with predictability , leading to very little tension , excitement , suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience . \\nin short , a clich ? -ridden formula film . \\nwelcome to my review of the general\\'s daughter . \\nplot : an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter\\'s rape , torture and murder . \\nthey must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush-hushes , to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder . \\ncritique : by the numbers ( see above ) . \\nthis film is just there . \\nit sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours , floats around , goes away , hopefully never to be heard from again . \\nit is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away . \\nit\\'s as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree . \\nit\\'s as action-packed as a canadian curling tournament . \\nget the picture ? \\ni sure did . . . it\\'s \\ntoo bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot , and to break down each scene before it was even completed . \\neasy as pie . \\nit\\'s unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film , but alas , t\\'was not to be ( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted . ) \\nwoods chews it up in the few scenes that he\\'s in , travolta passes the test , cromwell plays , well , cromwell , and stowe is window dressing with a smile ( mia since 12 monkeys ( 8/10 ) it seems ) . \\nand this predictability isn\\'t reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men , it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen . \\nit\\'s like riding a bike . \\nother scenarios which sponge out any tension , suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually \" breaking down \" to the investigators without much reason given , a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters , as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly , and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the \" best poor man\\'s michael bay doing his best poor man\\'s impression of tony scott \" ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half-open shades for grit and integrity , and an all-out rainfall for the finale for further chaos , and you\\'re a great director . \\nyawn . \\nyeah , whatever tony . . . i \\nmean , simon . ) \\nand aren\\'t we all sick of hearing about these army \" bad boys \" and their overdone \" code of silence \" ? ! \\nenough already ! \\nnext subject , please . \\nsee it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) . \\notherwise , save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead . \\nyou\\'ll feel much better afterwards . \\ntrust me . \\nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman , which eventually went to little dickie gere . \\nironically on james woods\\' part , he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv\\'s \" welcome back , kotter \" , starring none other than john travolta . \\nactor james woods recently confirmed reports of his \" big dick \" on howard stern\\'s radio program . \\nunlike rocker tommy lee , woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180 . \\nhe apparently scored a perfect 800 on his verbal sats and a 779 on the math section . \\nwhat a man ! \\njohn travolta is married to actress kelly preston , and they have a son named jett ( travolta loves them planes ! ) . \\nword on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis\\' home . \\ndirector simon west\\'s first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air ( 6 . 5/10 ) . \\nbefore that , he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants . \\nyippee ! \\nveteran director john frankenheimer ( ronin ( 7 . 5/10 ) , \\nthe manchurian candidate ) portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film . \\nthe imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 5 , 1968 , it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day . \\nclarence williams iii , who plays colonel fowler in this film , is known to some from his role as \" linc \" in the original \" mod squad \" tv series . \\nyounger folk may remember him as prince\\'s father in purple rain . \\n', b\"i've got to admit it . . . \\ni'm a huge jim carrey fan . \\ni loved the first ace ventura , as well as the mask and dumb and dumber--and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie ) , carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good . \\nuntil i saw ace ventura 2 , i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying . \\nsadly , ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be . \\ncarrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie , but this time it is no longer funny--it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i . \\nthe plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof ) . \\nsoon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and , if not returned in four days , will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other . \\nonce again , it's up to ace to save the day , using his uncanny detective skills . \\nthose who have been disappointed by carrey's more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over-acting to the best of his ability , but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn't capture the feel of the original . \\nthe original benefited from what looked to be carrey's constant hyped-up improv sequences , which were hysterically funny . \\nhere , however , the tighter script ( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies ) takes the improvised material from the first , and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie , giving carrey little chance to improvise . \\ninstead , his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly . \\nbut one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself . \\nin the first movie , he was always cool , and one step ahead of every one else--perfect for carrey's off-the-wall approach . \\nbut here , ventura is made to look a lot stupider , and is often made out as the straight guy--a role which is definitely not carrey's style . \\nthere are definitely some very funny moments , but they are few and far between . \\nthey are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura , or even dumb and dumber . \\n\", b\"'lake placid' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie , ok so maybe it is , but this one is enjoyable , and clever . \\nactually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film . \\nwell the ending is kinda scary , but in most horror/comedies they are . \\ni will admit that 'lake placid' isn't an oscar worthy film , but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny . \\nbridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating , is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth , after a man is bit in half . \\nshe gets there but really doesn't understand why she is there . \\nbill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened , along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man , they go out and find what is going on . \\nwhat they find though isn't great . \\na huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid , over 150 years old , he has migrated here for who knows why . \\nthey have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from . \\nbetty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid , and well you'll have to see the movie to find out . \\nher character is very funny and foul-mouthed , which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad , but funny . \\nto me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws . \\nwith the opening sequence , and some others , it is not original and is . \\nwhen you watch this movie , you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it . \\ndavid e . kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal , writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job . \\nthe characters have smartmouths , two foul , and some great one-liners . \\nbut believe me , don't take 'lake placid' too seriously or you won't like it . \\nbut it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun 'popcorn' type movie . \\nbut i guess it rates above the 'popcorn' rating . \\nsit back , watch the movie , laugh , scream , and whatever you want . \\neven though the movie is r , and i put violence and gore . \\nthere's really not that much gore , but what there is might seem kinda gross to some . \\n'lake placid' is a smart , clever , funny , and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too . \\n\", b'the best thing about , \" lake placid \" is that it\\'s only 80 minutes long and when it\\'s over you\\'re glad that you didn\\'t waste more than an hour and a half of your time . \\nit\\'s nothing more than a bad rip-off of , \" jaws \" ( and i think that\\'s being kind . ) \\nit was written by david e . kelly ( \" ally mcbeal \" ) as a horror-comedy but fails at both , miserably . \\ni was never scared and i think that i only laughed once . \\nthe crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , \" anaconda . \" \\nthe plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine . \\nthat brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish-and-game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate . \\nalso , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover ( oliver platt ) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast . \\nsoon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it . \\nthere\\'s also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets . \\nas i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor ( h20 ) don\\'t go for a serious approach towards the material but they also don\\'t have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either . \\nthe betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting , they\\'re all basically idiots . \\nif they had any brains the croc wouldn\\'t have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldn\\'t have put themselves in half of the situations that they did . \\nbut then again , if they were smart there wouldn\\'t be a movie . \\nbasically , \" lake placid \" is best undiscovered . \\n', b'i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world . \\nand i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it . \\nwriter/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning . \\nconvinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every \" thou shalt not \" of the ten commandments into a \" thou shalt \" ( and vice versa ) . \\nhis wife\\'s sister rachel ( \" friends \" \\' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel\\'s selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic . \\nthus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion . \\ntaplitz isn\\'t interested in treating seth\\'s tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him . \\ncomposer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth\\'s sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn\\'s performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain . \\nthe actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five-minute montage . \\nthe result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot . \\nit\\'s not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth . \\ncorporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth\\'s \" false witness . \" \\nonly courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve . \\neven she can\\'t force taplitz to decide whose story this is , or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite . \\nby the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film , it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience . \\ncommandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously . \\n', b'when walt disney pictures announced a live-action feature based on the \\'60s cartoon series of \" mr . magoo , \" special interests groups representing the vision-impaired let out a cry of dismay . \\nmr . \\nmagoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented . \\nin fact , they were wrong . \\nmr . \\nmagoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it\\'s an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity . \\nit\\'s stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas . \\nlook at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you\\'ll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr . \\nmagoo . \\nthe best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining . \\nthe worst , mr . \\nmagoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be . \\nthe first problem with mr . \\nmagoo is the script . \\ndespite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr . \\nmagoo is comically barren . \\nfrom beginning to end , there\\'s not a laugh to be found . \\nevery attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud . \\nyou\\'d think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that\\'s not the case . \\ni\\'ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures . \\nthen there\\'s leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) . \\nin the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun . \\nlately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr . \\nmagoo . \\neven if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we\\'re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but \" top form \" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here . \\nthis is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation . \\nthe story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber . \\nthe cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often . \\nthe bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) . \\nmatt keeslar portrays one of magoo\\'s sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo . \\nthe bumbling man\\'s other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus . \\nmost of mr . \\nmagoo\\'s humor comes in the form of failed slapstick . \\nthe cartoon violence level in this film doesn\\'t approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it\\'s still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices . \\nthere\\'s a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean\\'s recent , similar misadventure , it doesn\\'t hold up well . \\nthen there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo\\'s near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby . \\ni\\'m willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack . \\ntong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop . \\nhis chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) . \\nlike john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream . \\nit is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr . \\nmagoo appears to bore viewers of all ages . \\nthe screening i attended was wall-to-wall kids , and , for the most part , they didn\\'t seem to be enjoying themselves . \\nwhen the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it . \\nher pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words . \\nmr . \\nmagoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen . \\n', b\"synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case . \\nif she can survive the demanding s . e . a . l . \\ntraining , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps . \\nthrow in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie . \\nreview : the title of this movie turned me off at first . \\ni mean 'gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ? \\nthe other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i'm concerned . \\ni went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor . \\nto my surprise i really enjoyed the movie . \\nmoore as lieutenant jordan o'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men . \\nthe storyline is simple . \\nanne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push . \\nusing feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s . e . a . l . \\ntraining . \\njordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength . \\nthe training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch . \\nnonetheless , it's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours . \\nsure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer . \\nstepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer . \\nhis character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character . \\njordan's boyfriend royce is also in the military . \\nalthough they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has . \\nroyce ( what is his surname ? \\ndo we care ? ) \\nalmost resents jordan's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive . \\nhis character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military . \\nin parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it's hard not to cringe . \\ni still liked it though . \\nweaknesses in the script aside , this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood . \\nas we watch jordan's battle , it's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle . \\nthis is an individual's fight for self-advancement . \\nwe don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust down our throats . \\nit's enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not . \\n\", b' \" america\\'s sweethearts \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn\\'t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . \\nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting \" comic relief \" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . \\ncrystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \\n \" america\\'s sweethearts \" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . \\nit\\'s a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . \\nby the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . \\njohn cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . \\nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled \" time over time , \" are far from rosy . \\nwhile eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen\\'s solo films have tanked . \\nto make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a \" visionary \" who purchased the unabomber\\'s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . \\ndesperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . \\nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . \\nhe enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen\\'s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . \\nwhat lee doesn\\'t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . \\npress junkets are a haven for control freaks . \\nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . \\ngenerally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . \\nthe next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . \\nevery 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . \\nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . \\nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . \\nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . \\nthe \" reporters \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . \\nplacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . \\nthe junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . \\nfor most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . \\nwhen they do deal with journalists , the \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters \" premise is de-clawed . \\ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . \\nlee certainly isn\\'t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . \\nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? \\nhell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . \\nall of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn\\'t matter because any publicity is good publicity . \\nand thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . \\nso what about the cast ? \\njulia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . \\ncatherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . \\nby casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on \" comic relief \" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . \\nin supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed \" too broad . \" \\nseth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . \\ncome to think of it , \" little to work with \" is the operative phrase for this movie . \\nas a hollywood satire , \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is toothless . \\nas a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . \\nsuch a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . \\nhad it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been \" much ado about nothing . \" \\n', b'i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean\\'s war picture . \\ni still think that it doesn\\'t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute\\'s list of the 100 greatest american movies . \\nand i think that lumet\\'s \" 12 angry men \" , wilder\\'s \" witness for the prosecution \" and kubrick\\'s \" paths of glory \" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 . \\nbut i can\\'t deny the importance of \" the bridge on the river kwai \" - cinematically and in its contents . \\nthe film is set in burma in 1943 . \\na bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . \\nbut the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn\\'t work as simple workmen . \\nstruggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . \\nafterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . \\nhe considers it an opportunity to raise his men\\'s morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . \\nbut the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . \\na flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . \\nthey are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . \\nand the film doesn\\'t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in \" paths of glory \" . \\nlean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . \\nthis is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . \\nin this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film . \\nthe audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson\\'s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . \\nthe spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . \\n ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) \\nthat means , the picture isn\\'t perfect . \\nbut it has a lot of virtues as well . \\nit shows the \" madness \" of war and what war can produce in people\\'s minds . \\nit shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . \\nand \" the bridge on the river kwai \" is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . \\nthese points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . \\ndavid lean\\'s effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown . \\nalec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . \\nthe other actors deliver very good performances as well . \\njack hildyard\\'s fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful . \\ni like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses . \\n ( c ) karl rackwitz ( klein k ? ris , germany , 1999 ) \\n', b'the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer\\'s other comic book adaptation , batman and robin . \\nboth films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations . \\nin panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and \" rambo \" -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it\\'s much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures . \\nspawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead . \\nthough the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here\\'s what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan\\'s army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) . \\nhe is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon . \\nbut when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can\\'t be the evil superdemon he\\'s expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death . \\ntypical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video . \\nwhile the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn\\'s prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold . \\nbut the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don\\'t have a single scene together before simmons\\' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody\\'s guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) . \\nso many questions are left unanswered , and i\\'m sure they won\\'t be addressed in the inevitable sequel . \\nwhile last year\\'s the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power . \\nspawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven\\'t the faintest idea how to make a movie . \\n', b'brian de palma\\'s snake eyes stars nicolas cage\\'s evil twin , who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother . \\nlike a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload . \\nde palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic . \\nin snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast . \\nonly gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material . \\nthe rest of the actors become caricatures in this by-the-numbers thriller . \\nryuichi sakamoto\\'s atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene . \\nheavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder . \\n ( the script by de palma and lost world\\'s david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise . \\nonly the latter is achieved . ) \\ncage plays rick santoro , a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money . \\nthe movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held . \\nwith a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn\\'t know when to shut up . \\nspouting cliched and ridiculous dialog , he screams such lines as , \" i was made for the sewer , baby ! \" \\nactually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole . \\nsinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight . \\nbut most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess . \\nthe plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ? that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers . \\nthe flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not . \\nalthough a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie . \\nthe movie\\'s outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden . \\nthe film takes itself all too seriously . \\nat best , it is a 1940s-style b movie . \\na little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better . \\nand , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement . \\nsnake eyes runs 1 : 39 . \\nit is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers . \\n', b'in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather . \\nwas it \" deep \" ? \\nnope . \\nhowever it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up . \\nit was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was \" without the comic book uplift \" of the indiana jones and superman pictures . \\nwhich was true . \\nif what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man\\'s escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place . \\nif those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn . \\nsome critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr . lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that \" this is batman as batman should be . \" ; \\nmr . travers called it one of the ten best films of the year . \\nthe praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect . \\nthere was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton . \\nthe result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes . \\nthe villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman\\'s nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman\\'s body she gets pushed off a building . \\ni admire mr . burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess . \\nnothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten . \\nhints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast . \\nalas , these are only hints . \\nthere are , don\\'t misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis . \\na weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing . \\n', b'eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only . \\ncoincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox\\'s animated film anastasia was released . \\nyou know disney , they can\\'t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old \" masterpiece \" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . \\nlet no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . \\nthey still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . \\nbelieve it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time . \\nit took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom\\'s friends for a couple weeks . \\nthey had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times . \\nby the time i got back home , i promised myself i\\'d never see the movie . \\nbut promises are made to be broken , especially when you\\'re looking at a 17-day , limited engagement . \\ndamn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games . \\nthe little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it\\'s disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song . \\nit also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times . \\ni never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . . \\nthe heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase . \\nshe skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans . \\nshe\\'s also dealing with feelings she hasn\\'t had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn\\'t use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) . \\nher father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the \" savage \" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating . \\nwhat\\'s a king to do , though ? \\nthe girl\\'s in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn\\'t deter her . \\nariel saves the prince\\'s life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him . \\nshe makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) . \\nyou know she\\'s evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history . \\nshe also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl\\'s corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out . \\nshe\\'ll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . \\nand if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she\\'ll fall asleep forever . \\nit\\'s a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . \\nit ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the \\'50s . \\nall the elements are there -- memorable songs like \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl , \" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . \\nthe little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left . \\nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century ! \\n', b\"there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last . \\ngeorge lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy . \\nreturn of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films . \\nthe dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . \\ninstead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears . \\neven darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around . \\nwith the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman . \\nreturn of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back . \\nluke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine . \\ntheir goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt . \\nit is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play . \\nfrom a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch . \\nas soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor . \\nso , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks . \\nthere , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader . \\nreturn of the jedi has some interesting elements . \\nthe scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted . \\nfrom a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films . \\nnot only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved . \\non one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects . \\nin the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch . \\nthe acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films . \\nby now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas . \\nthe chemistry amongst the trio is terrific . \\nas in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for . \\nnewcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars . \\nalthough it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment . \\nwith the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang . \\ncongratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come . \\n , \\n\", b\"i think we should , as responsible citizens , all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie . \\nhe's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst . \\ni would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues , epilogues , etc . the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day . \\nho , ho . \\nnormally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr . \\ncarrey suceeds in making it unwatchable . \\ni laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing . \\ngrinding doesn't begin to describe . \\nit pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that , if you are a normal person , you leave feeling sick . \\nwhen it's not trying to be funny , it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying , stupid and sappy . \\nat best . \\nthis movie is intended to make people laugh , yes , not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound . \\nbut , it fails on every possible level . \\nit fails to be funny . \\nit fails to be insightful . \\nit fails to be suspensful . \\nit fails to be fun . \\nthey should pay people to see it . \\nit suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles , for having lived . \\nif you go in with the intention of coming out alive , please make sure that you are overly fond of boob , fart , pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane . \\nyes , literally insane . \\nstark , raving mad . \\nit is boring , stupid , melodramatic and in the end ugly . \\ni reccemond it strongly . \\nto ed wood . \\n\", b\"tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy . \\nrobbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss . \\nhe goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual 'ghetto' side of every american city . \\nthere , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin's on a trip to arizona . \\nthere , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers . \\nof course , there's gags along the way , usually from lawernce . \\nalthough the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there's something so horribly familiar about it all . \\nthis film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run . \\nit's full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a 'comedy' car chase , which just seemed so eighties . \\neven the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy . \\nthere also isn't much chemistry between robbins and lawernce . \\nin planes , trains and automobiles , there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy . \\nin nothing to lose , there is hardly chemistry at all . \\ntowards the end the chemistry seems to work , but for the bulk of the film , there is hardly any , \\nthe director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across . \\nand although there is no chemistry between the two leads , they give good performances on their own . \\nlawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin's is alright aswell . \\nhowever , robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob's ladder , and the player . \\nin fact , if you want to see robbin's do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier . \\nnothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however . \\nthe humour isn't particulary sophisticated , but if you enojyed dumb & dumber , you might enjoy this . \\nthe characters in arizona are funny , and there's also a good scene where robbin's asks a shopkeeper which 'threatening approach' was better , lawerences ( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper's ass , and swearing a lot ) , or himselfs , ( which was speaking in a deep , scary voice ) but the gags are predictable , the lack of chemistry infurating , and the ending too far-fetched and 'perfect' \\nnothing to lose then , is robbin's first 'bad' movie ( and hopefully his last ) , and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film . \\nhe nearly ruined carrey's career with ace ventura : when nature calls , let's hope he hasn't ruined robbin's ( or even lawerence's ) with nothing to lose . \\n\", b'once upon a time a solitary ogre named shrek ( mike myers ) was really annoyed to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice , seven dwarves and all the other fairy tale characters in the land , banished from their home by lord farquaad (

the fairy tale issue rescue she\\'s been expecting . \\nwhen fiona\\'s true colors are exposed ( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor ) , a spark develops between her and shrek . \\nthe script\\'s details are gleefully impish , constantly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad\\'s dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and \\'it\\'s a small world\\' parody of

) , although it won\\'t elicit the types of oohs and aahs of pixar\\'s work ( \" toy story , \" \" a bug\\'s life , \" \" toy story 2 \" ) . \\nin keeping with its hip style , pop music is used , which like myer\\'s voice may be initially jarring , but ultimately satisfies ( while surveying bridal candidates via a \\'dating game\\' parody broadcast by snow white\\'s evil queen\\'s mirror ,

rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] \\n \" rounders \" is exactly the kind of movie parents don\\'t want their kids to see . \\nit\\'s not that it\\'s a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it\\'s a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . \\nand to take make things \" worse \" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . \\nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the \" noir \" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . \\nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . \\nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . \\ndamon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . \\nmike\\'s about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . \\nbut then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . \\ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . \\nhe never sounds like he\\'s reading from a script , nor that he\\'s trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . \\nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys\\' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . \\nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn\\'t for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . \\nthe game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . \\nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . \\nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . \\nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . \\nwe learn only a little about mike , both past and present . \\npresently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . \\nthey go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike\\'s childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . \\nit\\'s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . \\ntechnically , the plot isn\\'t unlike many children\\'s sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid\\'s \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . \\nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . \\nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . \\nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he\\'s dealt and works with them . \\nsometimes they pay off ( i . e . \\nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don\\'t ( i . e . \\nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . \\nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . \\nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites\\' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . \\neverything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything\\'s a battle against the cards destiny deals . \\none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . \\nmatt\\'s good at gambling but he\\'s also got potential to be a great lawyer . \\nhe could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there\\'s stability but not much risk involved . \\ncan someone who\\'s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? \\nif the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . \\neverything is told from mike\\'s perspective , but we\\'re finally able to recognize some things on our own . \\nthis makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . \\nit works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . \\nwhat separates \" rounders \" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . \\n', b'ingredients : man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder , dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers . \\nsynopsis : what if you woke up one day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ? \\nin dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem . \\ndark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery . \\npoor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner . \\na mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats , as well as by the police , and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) . \\nis john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ? \\nhe searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues . \\nbut when the clues don\\'t fit , it doesn\\'t just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city . \\nto john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city . \\nhow come it\\'s always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ? \\nand how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ? \\nevery night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the \\'strangers\\' come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people\\'s heads with big hypodermic needles . \\nthe strangers have the ability to \\'tune , \\' or warp reality using telepathic powers . \\nturns out , the city is not on earth at all . \\nand the reason why john doesn\\'t fall victim to the nightly suspended animation , is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping abilities as the strangers . \\neven with the help of scientist dr . daniel schreber , can john take back the dark city ? \\nopinion : director alex proyas ( he also directed the crow ) mentions this in the dark city press kit : in films , science fiction is always \" used to have big spaceships blow up cities . \\ni think we\\'re a little tired of that . \" \\naccording to director proyas , probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers . \\nit\\'s designed so that you can watch the film over again , and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch . \\nit\\'s a philosophical piece . \\ncinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons , giant bugs , or proponents of the dark side of the force ) . \\nbut science fiction in books reaches beyond the \\'shoot-em-up\\' level and targets the big questions , questions like who are we ? \\nwhat is the human condition ? \\nwhat is ethical ? \\nwhat would a true human being do ? \\nfar from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtles , dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens , but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner . \\ndark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay . \\na little more than 200 years ago , the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian , military , conformist , medieval regimes . \\nthe people took refuge in religion , the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering , but after death , heaven would be available . \\nmeanwhile , the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes ; the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven . \\nwhen science finally overturned religion , the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments . \\nbut the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old . \\nthis is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud , kant , kafka , nietzsche , and dostoevsky pondered what society should be , and what place the individual had in it . \\nthe existentialists\\' in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile , indifferent , or alienated universe . \\nin dark city , when the last dying , defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens\\' scientific experiments on the human beings\\' brains failed , murdoch replies , pointing to his head , \" because the human condition isn\\'t located in here . \" \\n', b' \" mandingo \" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , \" a trashy potboiler \" that \" appeals only to the s&m crowd . \" \\nactually , i think \" mandingo \" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . \\nit\\'s too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . \\nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . \\none day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . \\nalthough the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . \\naccording to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . \\nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . \\nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . \\nmeanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . \\nhammond , however , is happier spending nights with his \" bed wench , \" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . \\nit is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . \\nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had \" pleasured \" her before he did . \\nof course , it\\'s fine that he\\'s slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a \" white lady , \" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . \\nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . \\nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . \\nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it\\'s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . \\nhammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . \\nyes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . \\njudging only by the plot , \" mandingo \" is pure sexploitation . \\nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . \\nwhen \" mandingo \" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . \\ndramatically , \" mandingo \" is weak and unfocused , and historically it\\'s mostly confused . \\nif one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . \\nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . \\nthe men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . \\nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but \" mandingo\\'s \" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there\\'s plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . \\nsome tried to write off \" mandingo \" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it\\'s not that easy . \\n \" mandingo \" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as \" the bible \" ( 1966 ) , the remake of \" king kong \" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated \" dune \" ( 1984 ) . \\nthe director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" ( 1954 ) and \" fantastic voyage \" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as \" the narrow margin \" ( 1952 ) . \\nthe script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on \" serpico . \" \\njames mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \\nso why is \" mandingo \" so bad ? \\na number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \\nwexler\\'s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( \" yessuh , massuh \" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( \" fer whut\\'re you gittin\\' outta bed ? \" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( \" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! \" ) . \\nfleischer\\'s direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \\nnevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \\ndespite its exploitative nature , \" mandingo \" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \\nuntil then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \\neven classics such as \" gone with the wind \" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \\n \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn\\'t all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \\nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film\\'s negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \\nwith a little more maturity and different handling , \" mandingo \" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \\nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \\nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler\\'s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \\nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but \" mandingo \" never does it . \\nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \\nthe difference between that film and \" mandingo \" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \\n \" mandingo \" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its \" trashy potboiler \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \\n', b'i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . \\nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid who\\'s had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he\\'s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \\nprofessor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \\nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \\na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will\\'s therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \\nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau\\'s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \\nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \\nwhat makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will\\'s life . \\nthe script\\'s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \\nlambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we\\'re not sure if we like what he has to say . \\nand sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \\nwill\\'s reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters\\' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \\nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \\nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \\n \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \\nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \\nwill\\'s relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the \\'f\\' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will\\'s character . \\nadd all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven\\'t given this film four stars . \\nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \\nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \\nstill , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of \\'97 films . \\n', b\"if snake eyes were a dog , you'd put it to sleep . \\nif it was a couch , you'd put it out on the sidewalk , where it would sit for a week . \\nif it were your child , you'd be reading military school catalogs . \\nif it were a ship -- no , it wouldn't be the titanic , that would imply glamor and tragedy -- it would be the exxon valdez . \\n ( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip . \\nfor whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup . \\nthis forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . ) \\nsnake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater . \\nsnake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where's the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ? \\nif i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ? \\nis it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage's oscar ? \\nwill someone please ( i'm begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ? \\nand how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ? \\nthe first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer . \\nif you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate . \\nthe trailer is a work of sheer genius . \\nit manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot . \\nthe expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross . \\n ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? ) \\nbut all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie . \\nthe trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match . \\nunfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot . \\nthe trailer gives away much , too much of the story . \\nthe shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy . \\nthe film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is . \\nwithout an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level . \\nas much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit . \\nde palma is maddeningly inconsistent . \\nhe can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way ) . \\non off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) . \\nsnake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value . \\nthe steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor . \\nthere is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done . \\nthis is what's called giving the devil his due . \\nbut the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie . \\nplacing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years . \\nsnake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent . \\ncage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better . \\nthe audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from our mind . \\nhowever , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie's title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps . \\n\",

and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained , and effective , performances . \\non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" the closet \" is a frankly sexual , adult 8 . \\nit\\'s so clever , in fact , that hollywood is already planning to re-make it in english , like \" la cage aux folles . \" \\n', b'oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! \\nin a perfect world , \" a civil action \" would be a breath of fresh air . \\nit\\'s cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn\\'t . \\nit\\'s romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn\\'t . \\nand , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending . \\neven if it\\'s based on a true story , a true story which hasn\\'t yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless . \\nhell , \" a civil action \" is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes \" the firm , \" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic ) . \\nyet it\\'s also oddly and slightly unsatisfying . \\nweird . \\nthis is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired \" search for bobby fischer \" ( didn\\'t see it ) and writer of none other than \" schindler\\'s list . \" \\nin short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories . \\nafter all , apart from the obvious it\\'s-a-holocaust-film and it\\'s-a-spielberg-film , isn\\'t \" schindler\\'s list \" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study . \\n \" a civil action \" is the same way : it\\'s narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study . \\nand it\\'s here that the film seems to go a bit wrong . \\nthe main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it\\'s an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that\\'s not necessarily the problem with the film . \\nit\\'s that it\\'s just kind of unsatisfying . \\nif this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way . \\nbut this film just seems to end , and i don\\'t want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won\\'t bitch about what is , essentially , genuine . \\nbut the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it . \\nit\\'s rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who\\'s shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he\\'s manipulative and he always wins . \\nit wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full . \\nwe see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don\\'t fully believe it . \\nand i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film\\'s conclusion that of incompleteness . \\nin the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases . \\nin short , he\\'s full of bullshit and we know it . \\nin the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river . \\npoint one , it\\'s not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren\\'t nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) . \\npoint two , it has been through several lawyers . \\nafter turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town\\'s company . \\nthey spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in \" wilde , \" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant . \\nthey also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) . \\nas we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) . \\nthings begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money . \\nas macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , \" fargo \" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist . \\nin fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i \\nsuppose like a grisham novel ) . \\nthis wouldn\\'t be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he\\'s seen as being still full of bullshit . \\nbecause he doesn\\'t take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out . \\nthe final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian\\'s mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he\\'s seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he\\'s not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film\\'s final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) . \\nthe fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it\\'s still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has . \\nwe need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life . \\nit only feels like half of that . \\nmaybe even less . \\nand it\\'s not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite . \\nup to then , though , it\\'s an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period . \\nthe reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it\\'s about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother . \\nwe learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can\\'t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find . \\nand duvall\\'s facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it\\'s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is . \\nfacher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him . \\nbut look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it\\'s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way . \\nthat\\'s why i liked this film : it\\'s hard to put a pointer on . \\nyou can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren\\'t sure what to make of it . \\ncall it the zallian effect . \\nsame thing happened with \" schindler\\'s list \" ( not that i\\'m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) . \\neach film is so greatly crafted that you can\\'t help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it . \\nif only it felt totally complete ( like , say , \" schindler\\'s list , \" though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air . \\n', b'synopsis : an aging master art thief , his supplier , and a young , buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be ( or are they ? ) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium . \\ncomments : this movie was boring . \\nplain and simple . \\nentrapment should not have been boring . \\nit stars sean connery , who can still carry an action film despite his age , catherine zeta-jones , a likeable enough film presence , and ving rhames , ultra-cool star of pulp fiction and mission : impossible . \\nit takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears ( a current \" hot topic \" in the news ) in its storyline , which is set at the end of 1999 . \\nit has some genuinely well-staged action sequences . \\nso , what went wrong ? \\nplenty , unfortunately . \\nthe major problem with entrapment is its script . \\nit has a been-there , done-that feel to it . \\nnothing seems particularly inventive or original , so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags ( it runs nearly two hours ) . \\nthe screenwriters , for example , periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes ( i . e . \\n \" 4 days to the millennium \" ) . \\nthis device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days . \\nthe characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth \" surprise \" revelation is made . \\nentrapment , in other words , relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character\\'s true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion . \\nthe star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can\\'t help but feel the actors are wasted in this production . \\nsean connery is given such mind-numbing lines as \" never trust a naked woman . \" \\nving rhames\\' character seems like an afterthought ; he\\'s not developed at all . \\nthe camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta-jones\\'s tight wardrobe . \\nthis , in and of itself , is not bad , but , after a while , it has a juvenile feel to it . \\nat least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they\\'re exploiting the female body . \\nentrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development ( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her , in tights , arc and pivot around laser beams ) . \\nthe tagline for this movie reads \" the trap is set . \" \\nit sure is , on those who spent money to see this movie . \\nentrapment really isn\\'t that bad ; it is watchable . \\ni would suggest , however , one waits until this is on cable or television to see it . \\n', b\"the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . \\nit's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . \\nsometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . \\nquality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . \\nbut too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . \\nflying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . \\nmostly it's laughable . \\nin hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . \\nbut iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . \\niron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . \\nbut it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . \\nunlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . \\niron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . \\niron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . \\nhowever , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . \\nin those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . \\nwhile in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . \\naka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . \\n\", b'the characters in jonathan lynn\\'s \" the whole nine yards , \" yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies ( 1999\\'s \" analyze this \" and \" mickey blue eyes , \" 2000\\'s \" gun shy \" ) , are rarely ever written as real people , but merely as one-dimensional caricatures . \\nwhen an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed , it is not to service the character development , or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations , but to accommodate the convoluted plot . \\nin a lightweight comedy , you might say , it is not required to have perfectly realized figures , just as long as they get the job done . \\nunfortunately , for a comedy to work , it has to at least succeed at being funny , and if there was a laugh-o-meter available , i\\'d guess that it briefly ascended around 2 . 5% of the time for me . \\nsuffice to say , the comedy in \" the whole nine yards \" works about as well as the broken-down lawnmower in my backyard , and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes , it is by sheer luck . \\nnicholas \" oz \" oseransky ( matthew perry ) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec . \\ntrapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie ( rosanna arquette , delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french-canadian accent ) , one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next-door . \\nwalking over to greet him , he is horrified to discover it is jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski ( bruce willis ) , a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison . \\nonce getting to know him and becoming his friend , oz is more comfortable with his identity , but for sophie , it means a possible hitman to do away with oz . \\nin her scheme , sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss ( kevin pollak ) about jimmy\\'s whereabouts , but in the process , he falls in love with jimmy\\'s wife , cynthia ( natasha henstridge ) , who is being held hostage . \\nupon return to quebec , and with one contrivance after the next , oz\\'s dental assistant , jill ( amanda peet ) , is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside \" the tulip , \" and forces him to set up a meeting , since jill\\'s dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself . \\nhave you got all that ? \\nbecause there is more . \\nmuch , much more . \\nand this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour . \\n \" the whole nine yards \" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures . \\nhow the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn\\'s 1985 comedy classic , \" clue : the movie . \" \\ngoing into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty-minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble . \\nsince the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing \" comedy \" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value . \\n \" the whole nine yards \" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill\\'s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark . \\na few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all . \\non the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis . \\nperry , innocuously enjoyable on tv\\'s \" friends , \" plays the same exact sitcom-style character in all of his movies ( from 1997\\'s \" fools rush in \" to 1999\\'s \" three to tango \" ) , and it has become a crushing bore . \\nmeanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background . \\ntheir three female counterparts fare noticeably better . \\nbest of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative \" species \" movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia . \\nhenstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent . \\namanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy . \\nit is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts . \\nfinally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time . \\nalso popping up is michael clarke duncan , fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in \" the green mile , \" as jimmy\\'s largely built friend and fellow killer , frankie figs . \\nwhen \" the whole nine yards \" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit . \\na great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ? \\nwithout a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments , \" the whole nine yards \" rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast , and half of the actors are not charming at all . \\nnow , what does that tell you ? \\n', b'the small-scale film , in limited release , \" waking ned devine \" is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town . \\nfilled with breathtaking scenery , \\'characters\\' , and delightful music , the movie would be interesting even without a plot . \\nthe story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review . \\nthe film starts out with a sharp opening , which gives us a taste of what is to follow : country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny . \\nwhat gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore . \\nwho that person is , and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelly ) . \\npart detectives , part scalawags , they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds . \\nthe village consists of several amusing characters . \\na clueless pig farmer , temporary priest , and a witch . \\nthere\\'s also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up-and-up . \\nthere are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ] . \\npacing is right . \\ntowards the end , it runs a bit out of steam , but that\\'s okay because for most of the 90 minutes we\\'ve been interested in the goings on . \\na mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment - all the right emotions are engaged . \\nin one brief dream sequence - you\\'ll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists . \\none of the key moments in the film . \\nthe music , available on cd ( london 289 460 939-2 ) follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering . \\na fine film that\\'s for everybody except action fans . \\nsomewhat like \\'the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , \\' . . . \\nbut livelier . \\n', b'i\\'m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \\ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson\\'s political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \\nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn\\'t do that . \\nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn\\'t quite do that either . \\na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick\\'s \" dr . \\nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn\\'t do that . \\nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \\nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \\nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn\\'t particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president\\'s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \\nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \\nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \\nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \\nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team\\'s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \\nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \\nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what\\'s going on and strikes a deal with the president\\'s electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \\nstill , even with the cia\\'s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \\nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn\\'t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \\nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \\nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \\nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss\\'s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \\nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn\\'t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \\nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \\nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \\nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \\nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss\\'s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \\ni think it\\'s fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \\nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \\nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn\\'t even real ? \\nwith this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . \\n', b\"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in . \\nwe hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves . \\nwithout an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye . \\neven without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . \\nbut do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? \\nexploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . \\nis the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? \\nmidnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . \\nas joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . \\nduring the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . ' \\nas joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . ' \\na troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . \\nhaving adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . \\njoe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . \\nhe romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . \\nby the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . \\njust as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . \\nbut how realistic are these ideals ? \\njoe had raped and been raped in texas . \\nthe scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . \\nalongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . \\nthe ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . \\nschlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . \\nwe understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . \\nhe runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . \\nin the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . \\nstanding up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . \\nschlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . \\nbeyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison . \\nthe fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation . \\nit is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . \\njoe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . ' \\nthere are two predominant images of new york . \\nthe first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . \\nthe other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . \\njoe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . \\nmirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . \\njoe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . \\nthe people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . \\nwhat has become of joe's american dream ? \\nschlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . \\njoe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . \\nat the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . \\ncontrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence . \\nthere is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . \\nthe party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals . \\njoe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils . \\nthe american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . \\nas joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . \\nhis masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . \\nfor joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . \\ntossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . \\nthe final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . \\ninstead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . \\nreflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice . \\nthe scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . \\nthe world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . \\nno longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . \\nmidnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . \\nthere is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . \\nthen there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . \\njoe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . \\nduring his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . \\nan allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons . \\n\", b'remember tom cruise and brian brown as rival bartenders juggling bottles of booze in \" cocktail \" ? \\nremember how stupid that looked ? \\nand remember the scantily-clad dancers of \" flashdance \" getting doused with buckets of water ? \\nwell , \" coyote ugly \" does those films five better ( or six better if you count john goodman ) , since here we have piper perado , maria bello , tyra banks , melanie lynskey , and izabella miko doing the absolut spinning and jiggling thing while pouring pitchers of perrier all over their semi-naked torsos . \\nno , goodman doesn\\'t flip jim beams or wear anything particularly risqu ?
