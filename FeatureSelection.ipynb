    "Feature selection reduces the dimensionalit of data for the following reasons:\n",
    "- Reduces overfitting by removing noise introduced by some of the features\n",
    "- Reduces training time, which allows you to experiment more with different models and hyperparameters\n",
    "- Reduces data acquisition requirements\n",
    "- Improves comprehensibility of the model because a smaller set of features is more comprehendible to humans. This enables us to focus on the main sources of predictability"

    "- Filter Methods: Apply a statistical measure and assign a score to each feature one at a time. Pearson's X2 and ANOVA F-Value based feature selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Wrapper Methods: Use a subset of features. Based on the results drawn from the previous model trained on that subset of features, they are either added or removed from the subset. The problem is essentially reduced to a search problem. Greedy algos (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) are the most desirable in multivariate feature selection scenarios because the wrapper methods are usually computationally very expensive and greedy algos don't necessarily provide the optimal solution, which is a good thing because it makes them less prone to overfitting. Forward Selection, Backward Elimination, Recursive Feature Elimination. "
